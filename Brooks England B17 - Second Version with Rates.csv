"As a bigger guy ( 5'11"" 230lbs ) I ride about 200 miles per week and am always looking to ride longer. I have tried a fair amount of saddles including the super fancy selle italia flite gel flow max which was OK for about a year. After about 3000 miles, it started to hurt more and more despite my weight dropping and extensive seat time. I have always heard these saddles were the most comfortable so I took the risk and IT WAS THE GREATEST CHOICE OF MY LIFE! From the first moment, there was a huge comfort increase. It felt like I was sitting on the sofa. On the first day, I rode it for 30 miles with no padded shorts to help break it in (Which was super comfortable) then the next day I rode 102 miles with padded shorts. The century was the most comfortable I have ever been on a bike and it is getting better. I wish I had bought this in the very beginning instead of looking for the sleek saddles that hurt. I have already gotten multiple compliments on its cools looks and find myself answering other people's questions on how comfortable it is.",5
"As the bike shop kid said, ""You'll swear at it the first 100 miles, and swear by it every mile after that."" Is it hard?  Yes...at first. Is it 'made' for everybody?  Like anything that has a 'fit,' probably not. I don't keep track of miles, but I've had this for about 8 months [riding 40 minutes each way to work, 5 - 6 days a week] and it began feeling comfortable after about a month and a half.  At first, I had sharp nerve pain on one side, but once the seat position was adjusted that pain went away and never returned. I'm 5'4""-ish [female], average weight and the men's B17 works for me.  I'm more slim-hipped than most women, so it probably wouldn't be for every female.  For me, it's well worth every penny.  I had been using cushy seat covers for years--cheaper in the short term, but they slip and slide plus the gel gets wonky after a few months.  Why not put that time on the bike in custom forming a great leather saddle that [over time] molds to *your* individual bum?",5
"I scored this just as my old Brooks Imperial began to tear. A warehouse deal in a ""damaged package"" meant that it had been opened, and the tension wrench was gone. Oh well. Best saddle for a bike at about the wholesale price? Cha-ching! Not my first Brooks, so I have the wrench already. Looking forward to this one out living the old bike, and being perfectly broken in on the next one. If you have never owned one of these... The beak in process is a big commitment; but super worth it. Easier than wearing wet jeans until they fit IMHO. That's ridiculous. Buy the official Proofhide conditioner, or a good product intended for baseball gloves. Nokona is what I use. Rub it in. Ride it. Add a little more occasionally. Sweating is okay if you keep it conditioned. But don't get leather wet. Rain covers exist. Get one if you commute. That's what ultimately killed my ~7 year old saddle. Don't get them wet. Don't feed them after midnight!",5
"As a young woman, I was an avide bike rider. This was before mountain bikes, century rides, charity ride, and I did this all on a 10 speed road bike..  Fast forward 30 years.  Life prevented me from ridding like I used to.  I was gifted with a bike a few weeks ago after telling numerous people of my plans to support my daughter on her 100 mile run by riiding along the route.  I have never been in such pain in my life with that factory seat.  Not 1 mile passed without my wanting to get off and give up.  Butts are not supposed to hurt like that, so I knew it was the seat.  An acquaintance asked what saddle I used before, and I remembered it was a Brooks leather saddle.  Well he convinced me that is what I needed. While reviews I have read indicated there is 1000 mile break-in period, for me it has been instant relief. My first ride was 4 miles of pure comfort, and each subsequent one has gotten longer and are equally comfortable.  I would recommend this saddle to anyone who plans on logging lots of miles.  Don't let the fact that it is hard  as rock out of the box fool you, it really is a superb seat!",5
"I first bought a Team Pro Imperial  (Honey Brown)  a couple of months ago to replace another saddle I had been using on my Cannondale R1000 road bike.  It felt great from the first time I rode using it.  I treated it per the instructions before installing it on my bike.  With some bar tape to match it has a great vintage look and is very comfortable.  My second ride with it was a mountainous metric century and I finished it with absolutely no discomfort from the saddle! I have been rebuilding an old touring bike and needed a saddle for it.  Since the Team Pro worked so well I decided to order another Brooks saddle.  My only fault (sort of) with the Team Pro is that there are no eyelets nor other good way to tie a tool bag to the seat.  So,  I ordered a B17 Imperial in standard width and brown color.  Dimensions are very similar to the Team Pro but the frame has eyelets for my toolbag.  One of the first things that I noticed is that the leather on the B17 is noticeably thinner than the leather on the Team Pro.  That makes the seat a bit more flexible and I guess it will be ""broken in"" a bit quicker than the other saddle.  As with the first saddle,  it was comfortable from the first time I sat on it.  That makes the break in time a non-issue for me. I am very pleased with both of my Brooks saddles.  They are a bit more comfortable for me than the ""men's anatomic saddles"" that I had been using previously.  There have been no perineal issues for me which can make a huge difference in whether a saddle works for  long hours on the bike or not.  I would not hesitate to buy another one in the future.",5
"I have ridden somewhere north of a half a dozen higher end saddles. Last year the saddle I had purchased really damaged one side of my butt so I decided to finally give this saddle a chance even though I thought I needed one of the fancy aerodynamic racing/endurance saddles. Well, I have to say that this saddle is so much better than any other saddle that I have ridden that I am completely in shock. Not only did the right side of my bum feel much better while on the Brooks saddle but it has actually healed up since I've gotten it. If you want a saddle that is going to treat you right then this is the one, bums down!",5
"I was a bit hesitant at first to buy this saddle. Upon my unboxing, it seemed a but hard. And I even had half the mond to return it. But this has by far been the best addition to my roadbike. I ride it to and from school nearly daily after having bought this but plan on making my roadbike as my main means of transport. What a differemce this B17 Standard saddle has made on my ride. Wow wow wow!!! They say ""only mileage can break this saddle in"" and this is true. But let me tell you I am a 5'2"" female weighing in about 125 measley pounds and it only took 4 rides (roughly 50 miles) before it started feeling cushy!!!! Granted I ride my bike with a backpack stuffed with my laptop and chemistry text book. But it feels amazing after having broken it in! I now prefer my bike to be my choice of transport. I use my car only when I had decided to sleep in a little bit longer. But I cannot stress what a difference this little saddle has made! You won't regret it.",5
"it looks amazing in the light.  it affixed and adjusted MUCH easier that the saddle i had with laces, which was a nightmare.  this is a MENS and i was worried it would be too long.  but, on the bike it is installed, i always found myself pushing back as i pedaled and i ran out of real estate on a WOMANs saddle.  this extra inch in the nose allows me to get in the drops with ease and slide to the back just as quickly.  b/c it's new, it is highly slick and very hard.  but i was not uncomfortable once.  i also noticed that having less width than that of the womans saddle meant i could pedal more naturally, pumping legs up and down much easier.  got to work in record time this morning.  i mistakingly used coconut oil on the leather underside to soften and prematurely break it in, like i have done to other leather saddles without issue.  but it caused the bright red to darken in spots, so am disappointed by that.  still, a refreshing albeit heavy change to the bike commute.  looks so great, i hardly noticed the extra effort needed to hoist the bike up stairs.  this saddle is heavier than the old womans saddle attached to the Thomson seat post!!  haha.  Brooks needs to get titanium under these finely crafted, and near perfect saddles.",4
"The B17 Special is just as comfortable to me as my old saddle, a Team Pro Imperial.  I wanted copper rivets but Brooks does not currently  make an Imperial cut saddle with copper rivets. The B17 Special on right is flatter on top, flares out to the sides more, and sits a little higher than the Team Pro Imperial on left. The leather is initially very dry and will soak up the first application of Proofide.  Compare the darker treated area to the lighter dry area.  It is easier to apply the first treatment of Proofide before you put the saddle on your bicycle. The frame is copper plated except the nose piece.",5
"I was hesitant to pull the trigger on a $90 bike seat but I'm glad I did.  I found it to be comfortable right out of the box and even more so over time.  I've only got about 50 miles on it but it's without a doubt the best saddle I've ever used.  I came from a Selle Italia seat which I liked a lot but after riding the Brooks and switching back I'm not sure how I put so many miles on the Selle.  It feels very rigid but definitely flexes in the right spots when you're sitting on it. The super smooth finish was also something I didn't realize would be so beneficial, basically zero friction no matter what kind of shorts you're wearing.  Of course, you've got to get the angle right or you'll slide forward/back a lot. I wasn't a fan of the old school look on a modern bike at first but it's really grown on me.  Hopefully this will be the last saddle I'll need...",5

"I scored this just as my old Brooks Imperial began to tear. A warehouse deal in a ""damaged package"" meant that it had been opened, and the tension wrench was gone. Oh well. Best saddle for a bike at about the wholesale price? Cha-ching! Not my first Brooks, so I have the wrench already. Looking forward to this one out living the old bike, and being perfectly broken in on the next one. If you have never owned one of these... The beak in process is a big commitment; but super worth it. Easier than wearing wet jeans until they fit IMHO. That's ridiculous. Buy the official Proofhide conditioner, or a good product intended for baseball gloves. Nokona is what I use. Rub it in. Ride it. Add a little more occasionally. Sweating is okay if you keep it conditioned. But don't get leather wet. Rain covers exist. Get one if you commute. That's what ultimately killed my ~7 year old saddle. Don't get them wet. Don't feed them after midnight!",5
"As a young woman, I was an avide bike rider. This was before mountain bikes, century rides, charity ride, and I did this all on a 10 speed road bike..  Fast forward 30 years.  Life prevented me from ridding like I used to.  I was gifted with a bike a few weeks ago after telling numerous people of my plans to support my daughter on her 100 mile run by riiding along the route.  I have never been in such pain in my life with that factory seat.  Not 1 mile passed without my wanting to get off and give up.  Butts are not supposed to hurt like that, so I knew it was the seat.  An acquaintance asked what saddle I used before, and I remembered it was a Brooks leather saddle.  Well he convinced me that is what I needed. While reviews I have read indicated there is 1000 mile break-in period, for me it has been instant relief. My first ride was 4 miles of pure comfort, and each subsequent one has gotten longer and are equally comfortable.  I would recommend this saddle to anyone who plans on logging lots of miles.  Don't let the fact that it is hard  as rock out of the box fool you, it really is a superb seat!",5
"I first bought a Team Pro Imperial  (Honey Brown)  a couple of months ago to replace another saddle I had been using on my Cannondale R1000 road bike.  It felt great from the first time I rode using it.  I treated it per the instructions before installing it on my bike.  With some bar tape to match it has a great vintage look and is very comfortable.  My second ride with it was a mountainous metric century and I finished it with absolutely no discomfort from the saddle! I have been rebuilding an old touring bike and needed a saddle for it.  Since the Team Pro worked so well I decided to order another Brooks saddle.  My only fault (sort of) with the Team Pro is that there are no eyelets nor other good way to tie a tool bag to the seat.  So,  I ordered a B17 Imperial in standard width and brown color.  Dimensions are very similar to the Team Pro but the frame has eyelets for my toolbag.  One of the first things that I noticed is that the leather on the B17 is noticeably thinner than the leather on the Team Pro.  That makes the seat a bit more flexible and I guess it will be ""broken in"" a bit quicker than the other saddle.  As with the first saddle,  it was comfortable from the first time I sat on it.  That makes the break in time a non-issue for me. I am very pleased with both of my Brooks saddles.  They are a bit more comfortable for me than the ""men's anatomic saddles"" that I had been using previously.  There have been no perineal issues for me which can make a huge difference in whether a saddle works for  long hours on the bike or not.  I would not hesitate to buy another one in the future.",5
"I have ridden somewhere north of a half a dozen higher end saddles. Last year the saddle I had purchased really damaged one side of my butt so I decided to finally give this saddle a chance even though I thought I needed one of the fancy aerodynamic racing/endurance saddles. Well, I have to say that this saddle is so much better than any other saddle that I have ridden that I am completely in shock. Not only did the right side of my bum feel much better while on the Brooks saddle but it has actually healed up since I've gotten it. If you want a saddle that is going to treat you right then this is the one, bums down!",5
"I was a bit hesitant at first to buy this saddle. Upon my unboxing, it seemed a but hard. And I even had half the mond to return it. But this has by far been the best addition to my roadbike. I ride it to and from school nearly daily after having bought this but plan on making my roadbike as my main means of transport. What a differemce this B17 Standard saddle has made on my ride. Wow wow wow!!! They say ""only mileage can break this saddle in"" and this is true. But let me tell you I am a 5'2"" female weighing in about 125 measley pounds and it only took 4 rides (roughly 50 miles) before it started feeling cushy!!!! Granted I ride my bike with a backpack stuffed with my laptop and chemistry text book. But it feels amazing after having broken it in! I now prefer my bike to be my choice of transport. I use my car only when I had decided to sleep in a little bit longer. But I cannot stress what a difference this little saddle has made! You won't regret it.",5
"it looks amazing in the light.  it affixed and adjusted MUCH easier that the saddle i had with laces, which was a nightmare.  this is a MENS and i was worried it would be too long.  but, on the bike it is installed, i always found myself pushing back as i pedaled and i ran out of real estate on a WOMANs saddle.  this extra inch in the nose allows me to get in the drops with ease and slide to the back just as quickly.  b/c it's new, it is highly slick and very hard.  but i was not uncomfortable once.  i also noticed that having less width than that of the womans saddle meant i could pedal more naturally, pumping legs up and down much easier.  got to work in record time this morning.  i mistakingly used coconut oil on the leather underside to soften and prematurely break it in, like i have done to other leather saddles without issue.  but it caused the bright red to darken in spots, so am disappointed by that.  still, a refreshing albeit heavy change to the bike commute.  looks so great, i hardly noticed the extra effort needed to hoist the bike up stairs.  this saddle is heavier than the old womans saddle attached to the Thomson seat post!!  haha.  Brooks needs to get titanium under these finely crafted, and near perfect saddles.",4
"The B17 Special is just as comfortable to me as my old saddle, a Team Pro Imperial.  I wanted copper rivets but Brooks does not currently  make an Imperial cut saddle with copper rivets. The B17 Special on right is flatter on top, flares out to the sides more, and sits a little higher than the Team Pro Imperial on left. The leather is initially very dry and will soak up the first application of Proofide.  Compare the darker treated area to the lighter dry area.  It is easier to apply the first treatment of Proofide before you put the saddle on your bicycle. The frame is copper plated except the nose piece.",5
"I was hesitant to pull the trigger on a $90 bike seat but I'm glad I did.  I found it to be comfortable right out of the box and even more so over time.  I've only got about 50 miles on it but it's without a doubt the best saddle I've ever used.  I came from a Selle Italia seat which I liked a lot but after riding the Brooks and switching back I'm not sure how I put so many miles on the Selle.  It feels very rigid but definitely flexes in the right spots when you're sitting on it. The super smooth finish was also something I didn't realize would be so beneficial, basically zero friction no matter what kind of shorts you're wearing.  Of course, you've got to get the angle right or you'll slide forward/back a lot. I wasn't a fan of the old school look on a modern bike at first but it's really grown on me.  Hopefully this will be the last saddle I'll need...",5
"As a bigger guy ( 5'11"" 230lbs ) I ride about 200 miles per week and am always looking to ride longer. I have tried a fair amount of saddles including the super fancy selle italia flite gel flow max which was OK for about a year. After about 3000 miles, it started to hurt more and more despite my weight dropping and extensive seat time. I have always heard these saddles were the most comfortable so I took the risk and IT WAS THE GREATEST CHOICE OF MY LIFE! From the first moment, there was a huge comfort increase. It felt like I was sitting on the sofa. On the first day, I rode it for 30 miles with no padded shorts to help break it in (Which was super comfortable) then the next day I rode 102 miles with padded shorts. The century was the most comfortable I have ever been on a bike and it is getting better. I wish I had bought this in the very beginning instead of looking for the sleek saddles that hurt. I have already gotten multiple compliments on its cools looks and find myself answering other people's questions on how comfortable it is.",5
"As the bike shop kid said, ""You'll swear at it the first 100 miles, and swear by it every mile after that."" Is it hard?  Yes...at first. Is it 'made' for everybody?  Like anything that has a 'fit,' probably not. I don't keep track of miles, but I've had this for about 8 months [riding 40 minutes each way to work, 5 - 6 days a week] and it began feeling comfortable after about a month and a half.  At first, I had sharp nerve pain on one side, but once the seat position was adjusted that pain went away and never returned. I'm 5'4""-ish [female], average weight and the men's B17 works for me.  I'm more slim-hipped than most women, so it probably wouldn't be for every female.  For me, it's well worth every penny.

My first ride was 4 miles of pure comfort, and each subsequent one has gotten longer and are equally comfortable.  I would recommend this saddle to anyone who plans on logging lots of miles.  Don't let the fact that it is hard  as rock out of the box fool you, it really is a superb seat!",5
"I first bought a Team Pro Imperial  (Honey Brown)  a couple of months ago to replace another saddle I had been using on my Cannondale R1000 road bike.  It felt great from the first time I rode using it.  I treated it per the instructions before installing it on my bike.  With some bar tape to match it has a great vintage look and is very comfortable.  My second ride with it was a mountainous metric century and I finished it with absolutely no discomfort from the saddle! I have been rebuilding an old touring bike and needed a saddle for it.  Since the Team Pro worked so well I decided to order another Brooks saddle.  My only fault (sort of) with the Team Pro is that there are no eyelets nor other good way to tie a tool bag to the seat.  So,  I ordered a B17 Imperial in standard width and brown color.  Dimensions are very similar to the Team Pro but the frame has eyelets for my toolbag.  One of the first things that I noticed is that the leather on the B17 is noticeably thinner than the leather on the Team Pro.  That makes the seat a bit more flexible and I guess it will be ""broken in"" a bit quicker than the other saddle.  As with the first saddle,  it was comfortable from the first time I sat on it.  That makes the break in time a non-issue for me. I am very pleased with both of my Brooks saddles.  They are a bit more comfortable for me than the ""men's anatomic saddles"" that I had been using previously.  There have been no perineal issues for me which can make a huge difference in whether a saddle works for  long hours on the bike or not.  I would not hesitate to buy another one in the future.",5
"I have ridden somewhere north of a half a dozen higher end saddles. Last year the saddle I had purchased really damaged one side of my butt so I decided to finally give this saddle a chance even though I thought I needed one of the fancy aerodynamic racing/endurance saddles. Well, I have to say that this saddle is so much better than any other saddle that I have ridden that I am completely in shock. Not only did the right side of my bum feel much better while on the Brooks saddle but it has actually healed up since I've gotten it. If you want a saddle that is going to treat you right then this is the one, bums down!",5
"I was a bit hesitant at first to buy this saddle. Upon my unboxing, it seemed a but hard. And I even had half the mond to return it. But this has by far been the best addition to my roadbike. I ride it to and from school nearly daily after having bought this but plan on making my roadbike as my main means of transport. What a differemce this B17 Standard saddle has made on my ride. Wow wow wow!!! They say ""only mileage can break this saddle in"" and this is true. But let me tell you I am a 5'2"" female weighing in about 125 measley pounds and it only took 4 rides (roughly 50 miles) before it started feeling cushy!!!! Granted I ride my bike with a backpack stuffed with my laptop and chemistry text book. But it feels amazing after having broken it in! I now prefer my bike to be my choice of transport. I use my car only when I had decided to sleep in a little bit longer. But I cannot stress what a difference this little saddle has made! You won't regret it.",5
"it looks amazing in the light.  it affixed and adjusted MUCH easier that the saddle i had with laces, which was a nightmare.  this is a MENS and i was worried it would be too long.  but, on the bike it is installed, i always found myself pushing back as i pedaled and i ran out of real estate on a WOMANs saddle.  this extra inch in the nose allows me to get in the drops with ease and slide to the back just as quickly.  b/c it's new, it is highly slick and very hard.  but i was not uncomfortable once.  i also noticed that having less width than that of the womans saddle meant i could pedal more naturally, pumping legs up and down much easier.  got to work in record time this morning.  i mistakingly used coconut oil on the leather underside to soften and prematurely break it in, like i have done to other leather saddles without issue.  but it caused the bright red to darken in spots, so am disappointed by that.  still, a refreshing albeit heavy change to the bike commute.  looks so great, i hardly noticed the extra effort needed to hoist the bike up stairs.  this saddle is heavier than the old womans saddle attached to the Thomson seat post!!  haha.  Brooks needs to get titanium under these finely crafted, and near perfect saddles.",4
"The B17 Special is just as comfortable to me as my old saddle, a Team Pro Imperial.  I wanted copper rivets but Brooks does not currently  make an Imperial cut saddle with copper rivets. The B17 Special on right is flatter on top, flares out to the sides more, and sits a little higher than the Team Pro Imperial on left. The leather is initially very dry and will soak up the first application of Proofide.  Compare the darker treated area to the lighter dry area.  It is easier to apply the first treatment of Proofide before you put the saddle on your bicycle. The frame is copper plated except the nose piece.",5
"I was hesitant to pull the trigger on a $90 bike seat but I'm glad I did.  I found it to be comfortable right out of the box and even more so over time.  I've only got about 50 miles on it but it's without a doubt the best saddle I've ever used.  I came from a Selle Italia seat which I liked a lot but after riding the Brooks and switching back I'm not sure how I put so many miles on the Selle.  It feels very rigid but definitely flexes in the right spots when you're sitting on it. The super smooth finish was also something I didn't realize would be so beneficial, basically zero friction no matter what kind of shorts you're wearing.  Of course, you've got to get the angle right or you'll slide forward/back a lot. I wasn't a fan of the old school look on a modern bike at first but it's really grown on me.  Hopefully this will be the last saddle I'll need...",5
"As a bigger guy ( 5'11"" 230lbs ) I ride about 200 miles per week and am always looking to ride longer. I have tried a fair amount of saddles including the super fancy selle italia flite gel flow max which was OK for about a year. After about 3000 miles, it started to hurt more and more despite my weight dropping and extensive seat time. I have always heard these saddles were the most comfortable so I took the risk and IT WAS THE GREATEST CHOICE OF MY LIFE! From the first moment, there was a huge comfort increase. It felt like I was sitting on the sofa. On the first day, I rode it for 30 miles with no padded shorts to help break it in (Which was super comfortable) then the next day I rode 102 miles with padded shorts. The century was the most comfortable I have ever been on a bike and it is getting better. I wish I had bought this in the very beginning instead of looking for the sleek saddles that hurt. I have already gotten multiple compliments on its cools looks and find myself answering other people's questions on how comfortable it is.",5
"As the bike shop kid said, ""You'll swear at it the first 100 miles, and swear by it every mile after that."" Is it hard?  Yes...at first. Is it 'made' for everybody?  Like anything that has a 'fit,' probably not. I don't keep track of miles, but I've had this for about 8 months [riding 40 minutes each way to work, 5 - 6 days a week] and it began feeling comfortable after about a month and a half.  At first, I had sharp nerve pain on one side, but once the seat position was adjusted that pain went away and never returned. I'm 5'4""-ish [female], average weight and the men's B17 works for me.  I'm more slim-hipped than most women, so it probably wouldn't be for every female.  For me, it's well worth every penny.  I had been using cushy seat covers for years--cheaper in the short term, but they slip and slide plus the gel gets wonky after a few months.  Why not put that time on the bike in custom forming a great leather saddle that [over time] molds to *your* individual bum?",5
"I scored this just as my old Brooks Imperial began to tear. A warehouse deal in a ""damaged package"" meant that it had been opened, and the tension wrench was gone. Oh well. Best saddle for a bike at about the wholesale price? Cha-ching! Not my first Brooks, so I have the wrench already. Looking forward to this one out living the old bike, and being perfectly broken in on the next one. If you have never owned one of these... The beak in process is a big commitment; but super worth it. Easier than wearing wet jeans until they fit IMHO. That's ridiculous. Buy the official Proofhide conditioner, or a good product intended for baseball gloves. Nokona is what I use. Rub it in. Ride it. Add a little more occasionally. Sweating is okay if you keep it conditioned. But don't get leather wet. Rain covers exist. Get one if you commute. That's what ultimately killed my ~7 year old saddle. Don't get them wet. Don't feed them after midnight!",5
"As a young woman, I was an avide bike rider. This was before mountain bikes, century rides, charity ride, and I did this all on a 10 speed road bike..  Fast forward 30 years.  Life prevented me from ridding like I used to.  I was gifted with a bike a few weeks ago after telling numerous people of my plans to support my daughter on her 100 mile run by riiding along the route.  I have never been in such pain in my life with that factory seat.  Not 1 mile passed without my wanting to get off and give up.  Butts are not supposed to hurt like that, so I knew it was the seat.

Last year the saddle I had purchased really damaged one side of my butt so I decided to finally give this saddle a chance even though I thought I needed one of the fancy aerodynamic racing/endurance saddles. Well, I have to say that this saddle is so much better than any other saddle that I have ridden that I am completely in shock. Not only did the right side of my bum feel much better while on the Brooks saddle but it has actually healed up since I've gotten it. If you want a saddle that is going to treat you right then this is the one, bums down!",5
"I was a bit hesitant at first to buy this saddle. Upon my unboxing, it seemed a but hard. And I even had half the mond to return it. But this has by far been the best addition to my roadbike. I ride it to and from school nearly daily after having bought this but plan on making my roadbike as my main means of transport. What a differemce this B17 Standard saddle has made on my ride. Wow wow wow!!! They say ""only mileage can break this saddle in"" and this is true. But let me tell you I am a 5'2"" female weighing in about 125 measley pounds and it only took 4 rides (roughly 50 miles) before it started feeling cushy!!!! Granted I ride my bike with a backpack stuffed with my laptop and chemistry text book. But it feels amazing after having broken it in! I now prefer my bike to be my choice of transport. I use my car only when I had decided to sleep in a little bit longer. But I cannot stress what a difference this little saddle has made! You won't regret it.",5
"it looks amazing in the light.  it affixed and adjusted MUCH easier that the saddle i had with laces, which was a nightmare.  this is a MENS and i was worried it would be too long.  but, on the bike it is installed, i always found myself pushing back as i pedaled and i ran out of real estate on a WOMANs saddle.  this extra inch in the nose allows me to get in the drops with ease and slide to the back just as quickly.  b/c it's new, it is highly slick and very hard.  but i was not uncomfortable once.  i also noticed that having less width than that of the womans saddle meant i could pedal more naturally, pumping legs up and down much easier.  got to work in record time this morning.  i mistakingly used coconut oil on the leather underside to soften and prematurely break it in, like i have done to other leather saddles without issue.  but it caused the bright red to darken in spots, so am disappointed by that.  still, a refreshing albeit heavy change to the bike commute.  looks so great, i hardly noticed the extra effort needed to hoist the bike up stairs.  this saddle is heavier than the old womans saddle attached to the Thomson seat post!!  haha.  Brooks needs to get titanium under these finely crafted, and near perfect saddles.",4
"The B17 Special is just as comfortable to me as my old saddle, a Team Pro Imperial.  I wanted copper rivets but Brooks does not currently  make an Imperial cut saddle with copper rivets. The B17 Special on right is flatter on top, flares out to the sides more, and sits a little higher than the Team Pro Imperial on left. The leather is initially very dry and will soak up the first application of Proofide.  Compare the darker treated area to the lighter dry area.  It is easier to apply the first treatment of Proofide before you put the saddle on your bicycle. The frame is copper plated except the nose piece.",5
"I was hesitant to pull the trigger on a $90 bike seat but I'm glad I did.  I found it to be comfortable right out of the box and even more so over time.  I've only got about 50 miles on it but it's without a doubt the best saddle I've ever used.  I came from a Selle Italia seat which I liked a lot but after riding the Brooks and switching back I'm not sure how I put so many miles on the Selle.  It feels very rigid but definitely flexes in the right spots when you're sitting on it. The super smooth finish was also something I didn't realize would be so beneficial, basically zero friction no matter what kind of shorts you're wearing.  Of course, you've got to get the angle right or you'll slide forward/back a lot. I wasn't a fan of the old school look on a modern bike at first but it's really grown on me.  Hopefully this will be the last saddle I'll need...",5
"As a bigger guy ( 5'11"" 230lbs ) I ride about 200 miles per week and am always looking to ride longer. I have tried a fair amount of saddles including the super fancy selle italia flite gel flow max which was OK for about a year. After about 3000 miles, it started to hurt more and more despite my weight dropping and extensive seat time. I have always heard these saddles were the most comfortable so I took the risk and IT WAS THE GREATEST CHOICE OF MY LIFE! From the first moment, there was a huge comfort increase. It felt like I was sitting on the sofa. On the first day, I rode it for 30 miles with no padded shorts to help break it in (Which was super comfortable) then the next day I rode 102 miles with padded shorts. The century was the most comfortable I have ever been on a bike and it is getting better. I wish I had bought this in the very beginning instead of looking for the sleek saddles that hurt. I have already gotten multiple compliments on its cools looks and find myself answering other people's questions on how comfortable it is.",5
"As the bike shop kid said, ""You'll swear at it the first 100 miles, and swear by it every mile after that."" Is it hard?  Yes...at first. Is it 'made' for everybody?  Like anything that has a 'fit,' probably not. I don't keep track of miles, but I've had this for about 8 months [riding 40 minutes each way to work, 5 - 6 days a week] and it began feeling comfortable after about a month and a half.  At first, I had sharp nerve pain on one side, but once the seat position was adjusted that pain went away and never returned. I'm 5'4""-ish [female], average weight and the men's B17 works for me.  I'm more slim-hipped than most women, so it probably wouldn't be for every female.  For me, it's well worth every penny.  I had been using cushy seat covers for years--cheaper in the short term, but they slip and slide plus the gel gets wonky after a few months.  Why not put that time on the bike in custom forming a great leather saddle that [over time] molds to *your* individual bum?",5
"I scored this just as my old Brooks Imperial began to tear. A warehouse deal in a ""damaged package"" meant that it had been opened, and the tension wrench was gone. Oh well. Best saddle for a bike at about the wholesale price? Cha-ching! Not my first Brooks, so I have the wrench already. Looking forward to this one out living the old bike, and being perfectly broken in on the next one. If you have never owned one of these... The beak in process is a big commitment; but super worth it. Easier than wearing wet jeans until they fit IMHO. That's ridiculous. Buy the official Proofhide conditioner, or a good product intended for baseball gloves. Nokona is what I use. Rub it in. Ride it. Add a little more occasionally. Sweating is okay if you keep it conditioned. But don't get leather wet. Rain covers exist. Get one if you commute. That's what ultimately killed my ~7 year old saddle. Don't get them wet. Don't feed them after midnight!",5
"As a young woman, I was an avide bike rider. This was before mountain bikes, century rides, charity ride, and I did this all on a 10 speed road bike..  Fast forward 30 years.  Life prevented me from ridding like I used to.  I was gifted with a bike a few weeks ago after telling numerous people of my plans to support my daughter on her 100 mile run by riiding along the route.  I have never been in such pain in my life with that factory seat.  Not 1 mile passed without my wanting to get off and give up.  Butts are not supposed to hurt like that, so I knew it was the seat.  An acquaintance asked what saddle I used before, and I remembered it was a Brooks leather saddle.  Well he convinced me that is what I needed. While reviews I have read indicated there is 1000 mile break-in period, for me it has been instant relief. My first ride was 4 miles of pure comfort, and each subsequent one has gotten longer and are equally comfortable.  I would recommend this saddle to anyone who plans on logging lots of miles.  Don't let the fact that it is hard  as rock out of the box fool you, it really is a superb seat!",5
"I first bought a Team Pro Imperial  (Honey Brown)  a couple of months ago to replace another saddle I had been using on my Cannondale R1000 road bike.  It felt great from the first time I rode using it.  I treated it per the instructions before installing it on my bike.  With some bar tape to match it has a great vintage look and is very comfortable.  My second ride with it was a mountainous metric century and I finished it with absolutely no discomfort from the saddle! I have been rebuilding an old touring bike and needed a saddle for it.  Since the Team Pro worked so well I decided to order another Brooks saddle.  My only fault (sort of) with the Team Pro is that there are no eyelets nor other good way to tie a tool bag to the seat.  So,  I ordered a B17 Imperial in standard width and brown color.  Dimensions are very similar to the Team Pro but the frame has eyelets for my toolbag.  One of the first things that I noticed is that the leather on the B17 is noticeably thinner than the leather on the Team Pro.  That makes the seat a bit more flexible and I guess it will be ""broken in"" a bit quicker than the other saddle.  As with the first saddle,  it was comfortable from the first time I sat on it.  That makes the break in time a non-issue for me. I am very pleased with both of my Brooks saddles.  They are a bit more comfortable for me than the ""men's anatomic saddles"" that I had been using previously.  There have been no perineal issues for me which can make a huge difference in whether a saddle works for  long hours on the bike or not.  I would not hesitate to buy another one in the future.",5

"it looks amazing in the light.  it affixed and adjusted MUCH easier that the saddle i had with laces, which was a nightmare.  this is a MENS and i was worried it would be too long.  but, on the bike it is installed, i always found myself pushing back as i pedaled and i ran out of real estate on a WOMANs saddle.  this extra inch in the nose allows me to get in the drops with ease and slide to the back just as quickly.  b/c it's new, it is highly slick and very hard.  but i was not uncomfortable once.  i also noticed that having less width than that of the womans saddle meant i could pedal more naturally, pumping legs up and down much easier.  got to work in record time this morning.  i mistakingly used coconut oil on the leather underside to soften and prematurely break it in, like i have done to other leather saddles without issue.  but it caused the bright red to darken in spots, so am disappointed by that.  still, a refreshing albeit heavy change to the bike commute.  looks so great, i hardly noticed the extra effort needed to hoist the bike up stairs.  this saddle is heavier than the old womans saddle attached to the Thomson seat post!!  haha.  Brooks needs to get titanium under these finely crafted, and near perfect saddles.",4
"The B17 Special is just as comfortable to me as my old saddle, a Team Pro Imperial.  I wanted copper rivets but Brooks does not currently  make an Imperial cut saddle with copper rivets. The B17 Special on right is flatter on top, flares out to the sides more, and sits a little higher than the Team Pro Imperial on left. The leather is initially very dry and will soak up the first application of Proofide.  Compare the darker treated area to the lighter dry area.  It is easier to apply the first treatment of Proofide before you put the saddle on your bicycle. The frame is copper plated except the nose piece.",5
"I was hesitant to pull the trigger on a $90 bike seat but I'm glad I did.  I found it to be comfortable right out of the box and even more so over time.  I've only got about 50 miles on it but it's without a doubt the best saddle I've ever used.  I came from a Selle Italia seat which I liked a lot but after riding the Brooks and switching back I'm not sure how I put so many miles on the Selle.  It feels very rigid but definitely flexes in the right spots when you're sitting on it. The super smooth finish was also something I didn't realize would be so beneficial, basically zero friction no matter what kind of shorts you're wearing.  Of course, you've got to get the angle right or you'll slide forward/back a lot. I wasn't a fan of the old school look on a modern bike at first but it's really grown on me.  Hopefully this will be the last saddle I'll need...",5
"As a bigger guy ( 5'11"" 230lbs ) I ride about 200 miles per week and am always looking to ride longer. I have tried a fair amount of saddles including the super fancy selle italia flite gel flow max which was OK for about a year. After about 3000 miles, it started to hurt more and more despite my weight dropping and extensive seat time. I have always heard these saddles were the most comfortable so I took the risk and IT WAS THE GREATEST CHOICE OF MY LIFE! From the first moment, there was a huge comfort increase. It felt like I was sitting on the sofa. On the first day, I rode it for 30 miles with no padded shorts to help break it in (Which was super comfortable) then the next day I rode 102 miles with padded shorts. The century was the most comfortable I have ever been on a bike and it is getting better. I wish I had bought this in the very beginning instead of looking for the sleek saddles that hurt. I have already gotten multiple compliments on its cools looks and find myself answering other people's questions on how comfortable it is.",5
"As the bike shop kid said, ""You'll swear at it the first 100 miles, and swear by it every mile after that."" Is it hard?  Yes...at first. Is it 'made' for everybody?  Like anything that has a 'fit,' probably not. I don't keep track of miles, but I've had this for about 8 months [riding 40 minutes each way to work, 5 - 6 days a week] and it began feeling comfortable after about a month and a half.  At first, I had sharp nerve pain on one side, but once the seat position was adjusted that pain went away and never returned. I'm 5'4""-ish [female], average weight and the men's B17 works for me.  I'm more slim-hipped than most women, so it probably wouldn't be for every female.  For me, it's well worth every penny.  I had been using cushy seat covers for years--cheaper in the short term, but they slip and slide plus the gel gets wonky after a few months.  Why not put that time on the bike in custom forming a great leather saddle that [over time] molds to *your* individual bum?",5
"I scored this just as my old Brooks Imperial began to tear. A warehouse deal in a ""damaged package"" meant that it had been opened, and the tension wrench was gone. Oh well. Best saddle for a bike at about the wholesale price? Cha-ching! Not my first Brooks, so I have the wrench already. Looking forward to this one out living the old bike, and being perfectly broken in on the next one. If you have never owned one of these... The beak in process is a big commitment; but super worth it. Easier than wearing wet jeans until they fit IMHO. That's ridiculous. Buy the official Proofhide conditioner, or a good product intended for baseball gloves. Nokona is what I use. Rub it in. Ride it. Add a little more occasionally. Sweating is okay if you keep it conditioned. But don't get leather wet. Rain covers exist. Get one if you commute. That's what ultimately killed my ~7 year old saddle. Don't get them wet. Don't feed them after midnight!",5
"As a young woman, I was an avide bike rider. This was before mountain bikes, century rides, charity ride, and I did this all on a 10 speed road bike..  Fast forward 30 years.  Life prevented me from ridding like I used to.  I was gifted with a bike a few weeks ago after telling numerous people of my plans to support my daughter on her 100 mile run by riiding along the route.  I have never been in such pain in my life with that factory seat.  Not 1 mile passed without my wanting to get off and give up.  Butts are not supposed to hurt like that, so I knew it was the seat.  An acquaintance asked what saddle I used before, and I remembered it was a Brooks leather saddle.  Well he convinced me that is what I needed. While reviews I have read indicated there is 1000 mile break-in period, for me it has been instant relief. My first ride was 4 miles of pure comfort, and each subsequent one has gotten longer and are equally comfortable.  I would recommend this saddle to anyone who plans on logging lots of miles.  Don't let the fact that it is hard  as rock out of the box fool you, it really is a superb seat!",5
"I first bought a Team Pro Imperial  (Honey Brown)  a couple of months ago to replace another saddle I had been using on my Cannondale R1000 road bike.  It felt great from the first time I rode using it.  I treated it per the instructions before installing it on my bike.  With some bar tape to match it has a great vintage look and is very comfortable.  My second ride with it was a mountainous metric century and I finished it with absolutely no discomfort from the saddle! I have been rebuilding an old touring bike and needed a saddle for it.  Since the Team Pro worked so well I decided to order another Brooks saddle.  My only fault (sort of) with the Team Pro is that there are no eyelets nor other good way to tie a tool bag to the seat.  So,  I ordered a B17 Imperial in standard width and brown color.  Dimensions are very similar to the Team Pro but the frame has eyelets for my toolbag.  One of the first things that I noticed is that the leather on the B17 is noticeably thinner than the leather on the Team Pro.  That makes the seat a bit more flexible and I guess it will be ""broken in"" a bit quicker than the other saddle.  As with the first saddle,  it was comfortable from the first time I sat on it.  That makes the break in time a non-issue for me. I am very pleased with both of my Brooks saddles.  They are a bit more comfortable for me than the ""men's anatomic saddles"" that I had been using previously.  There have been no perineal issues for me which can make a huge difference in whether a saddle works for  long hours on the bike or not.  I would not hesitate to buy another one in the future.",5
"I have ridden somewhere north of a half a dozen higher end saddles. Last year the saddle I had purchased really damaged one side of my butt so I decided to finally give this saddle a chance even though I thought I needed one of the fancy aerodynamic racing/endurance saddles. Well, I have to say that this saddle is so much better than any other saddle that I have ridden that I am completely in shock. Not only did the right side of my bum feel much better while on the Brooks saddle but it has actually healed up since I've gotten it. If you want a saddle that is going to treat you right then this is the one, bums down!",5
"I was a bit hesitant at first to buy this saddle. Upon my unboxing, it seemed a but hard. And I even had half the mond to return it. But this has by far been the best addition to my roadbike. I ride it to and from school nearly daily after having bought this but plan on making my roadbike as my main means of transport. What a differemce this B17 Standard saddle has made on my ride. Wow wow wow!!! They say ""only mileage can break this saddle in"" and this is true. But let me tell you I am a 5'2"" female weighing in about 125 measley pounds and it only took 4 rides (roughly 50 miles) before it started feeling cushy!!!!

"I was hesitant to pull the trigger on a $90 bike seat but I'm glad I did.  I found it to be comfortable right out of the box and even more so over time.  I've only got about 50 miles on it but it's without a doubt the best saddle I've ever used.  I came from a Selle Italia seat which I liked a lot but after riding the Brooks and switching back I'm not sure how I put so many miles on the Selle.  It feels very rigid but definitely flexes in the right spots when you're sitting on it. The super smooth finish was also something I didn't realize would be so beneficial, basically zero friction no matter what kind of shorts you're wearing.  Of course, you've got to get the angle right or you'll slide forward/back a lot. I wasn't a fan of the old school look on a modern bike at first but it's really grown on me.  Hopefully this will be the last saddle I'll need...",5
"As a bigger guy ( 5'11"" 230lbs ) I ride about 200 miles per week and am always looking to ride longer. I have tried a fair amount of saddles including the super fancy selle italia flite gel flow max which was OK for about a year. After about 3000 miles, it started to hurt more and more despite my weight dropping and extensive seat time. I have always heard these saddles were the most comfortable so I took the risk and IT WAS THE GREATEST CHOICE OF MY LIFE! From the first moment, there was a huge comfort increase. It felt like I was sitting on the sofa. On the first day, I rode it for 30 miles with no padded shorts to help break it in (Which was super comfortable) then the next day I rode 102 miles with padded shorts. The century was the most comfortable I have ever been on a bike and it is getting better. I wish I had bought this in the very beginning instead of looking for the sleek saddles that hurt. I have already gotten multiple compliments on its cools looks and find myself answering other people's questions on how comfortable it is.",5
"As the bike shop kid said, ""You'll swear at it the first 100 miles, and swear by it every mile after that."" Is it hard?  Yes...at first. Is it 'made' for everybody?  Like anything that has a 'fit,' probably not. I don't keep track of miles, but I've had this for about 8 months [riding 40 minutes each way to work, 5 - 6 days a week] and it began feeling comfortable after about a month and a half.  At first, I had sharp nerve pain on one side, but once the seat position was adjusted that pain went away and never returned. I'm 5'4""-ish [female], average weight and the men's B17 works for me.  I'm more slim-hipped than most women, so it probably wouldn't be for every female.  For me, it's well worth every penny.  I had been using cushy seat covers for years--cheaper in the short term, but they slip and slide plus the gel gets wonky after a few months.  Why not put that time on the bike in custom forming a great leather saddle that [over time] molds to *your* individual bum?",5
"I scored this just as my old Brooks Imperial began to tear. A warehouse deal in a ""damaged package"" meant that it had been opened, and the tension wrench was gone. Oh well. Best saddle for a bike at about the wholesale price? Cha-ching! Not my first Brooks, so I have the wrench already. Looking forward to this one out living the old bike, and being perfectly broken in on the next one. If you have never owned one of these... The beak in process is a big commitment; but super worth it. Easier than wearing wet jeans until they fit IMHO. That's ridiculous. Buy the official Proofhide conditioner, or a good product intended for baseball gloves. Nokona is what I use. Rub it in. Ride it. Add a little more occasionally. Sweating is okay if you keep it conditioned. But don't get leather wet. Rain covers exist. Get one if you commute. That's what ultimately killed my ~7 year old saddle. Don't get them wet. Don't feed them after midnight!",5
"As a young woman, I was an avide bike rider. This was before mountain bikes, century rides, charity ride, and I did this all on a 10 speed road bike..  Fast forward 30 years.  Life prevented me from ridding like I used to.  I was gifted with a bike a few weeks ago after telling numerous people of my plans to support my daughter on her 100 mile run by riiding along the route.  I have never been in such pain in my life with that factory seat.  Not 1 mile passed without my wanting to get off and give up.  Butts are not supposed to hurt like that, so I knew it was the seat.  An acquaintance asked what saddle I used before, and I remembered it was a Brooks leather saddle.  Well he convinced me that is what I needed. While reviews I have read indicated there is 1000 mile break-in period, for me it has been instant relief. My first ride was 4 miles of pure comfort, and each subsequent one has gotten longer and are equally comfortable.  I would recommend this saddle to anyone who plans on logging lots of miles.  Don't let the fact that it is hard  as rock out of the box fool you, it really is a superb seat!",5
"I first bought a Team Pro Imperial  (Honey Brown)  a couple of months ago to replace another saddle I had been using on my Cannondale R1000 road bike.  It felt great from the first time I rode using it.  I treated it per the instructions before installing it on my bike.  With some bar tape to match it has a great vintage look and is very comfortable.  My second ride with it was a mountainous metric century and I finished it with absolutely no discomfort from the saddle! I have been rebuilding an old touring bike and needed a saddle for it.  Since the Team Pro worked so well I decided to order another Brooks saddle.  My only fault (sort of) with the Team Pro is that there are no eyelets nor other good way to tie a tool bag to the seat.  So,  I ordered a B17 Imperial in standard width and brown color.  Dimensions are very similar to the Team Pro but the frame has eyelets for my toolbag.  One of the first things that I noticed is that the leather on the B17 is noticeably thinner than the leather on the Team Pro.  That makes the seat a bit more flexible and I guess it will be ""broken in"" a bit quicker than the other saddle.  As with the first saddle,  it was comfortable from the first time I sat on it.  That makes the break in time a non-issue for me. I am very pleased with both of my Brooks saddles.  They are a bit more comfortable for me than the ""men's anatomic saddles"" that I had been using previously.  There have been no perineal issues for me which can make a huge difference in whether a saddle works for  long hours on the bike or not.  I would not hesitate to buy another one in the future.",5
"I have ridden somewhere north of a half a dozen higher end saddles. Last year the saddle I had purchased really damaged one side of my butt so I decided to finally give this saddle a chance even though I thought I needed one of the fancy aerodynamic racing/endurance saddles. Well, I have to say that this saddle is so much better than any other saddle that I have ridden that I am completely in shock. Not only did the right side of my bum feel much better while on the Brooks saddle but it has actually healed up since I've gotten it. If you want a saddle that is going to treat you right then this is the one, bums down!",5
"I was a bit hesitant at first to buy this saddle. Upon my unboxing, it seemed a but hard. And I even had half the mond to return it. But this has by far been the best addition to my roadbike. I ride it to and from school nearly daily after having bought this but plan on making my roadbike as my main means of transport. What a differemce this B17 Standard saddle has made on my ride. Wow wow wow!!! They say ""only mileage can break this saddle in"" and this is true. But let me tell you I am a 5'2"" female weighing in about 125 measley pounds and it only took 4 rides (roughly 50 miles) before it started feeling cushy!!!! Granted I ride my bike with a backpack stuffed with my laptop and chemistry text book. But it feels amazing after having broken it in! I now prefer my bike to be my choice of transport. I use my car only when I had decided to sleep in a little bit longer. But I cannot stress what a difference this little saddle has made! You won't regret it.",5
"it looks amazing in the light.  it affixed and adjusted MUCH easier that the saddle i had with laces, which was a nightmare.  this is a MENS and i was worried it would be too long.  but, on the bike it is installed, i always found myself pushing back as i pedaled and i ran out of real estate on a WOMANs saddle.  this extra inch in the nose allows me to get in the drops with ease and slide to the back just as quickly.  b/c it's new, it is highly slick and very hard.  but i was not uncomfortable once.  i also noticed that having less width than that of the womans saddle meant i could pedal more naturally, pumping legs up and down much easier.  got to work in record time this morning.  i mistakingly used coconut oil on the leather underside to soften and prematurely break it in, like i have done to other leather saddles without issue.  but it caused the bright red to darken in spots, so am disappointed by that.  still, a refreshing albeit heavy change to the bike commute.  looks so great, i hardly noticed the extra effort needed to hoist the bike up stairs.  this saddle is heavier than the old womans saddle attached to the Thomson seat post!!  haha.  Brooks needs to get titanium under these finely crafted, and near perfect saddles.",4
"The B17 Special is just as comfortable to me as my old saddle, a Team Pro Imperial.  I wanted copper rivets but Brooks does not currently  make an Imperial cut saddle with copper rivets. The B17 Special on right is flatter on top, flares out to the sides more, and sits a little higher than the Team Pro Imperial on left.

I have already gotten multiple compliments on its cools looks and find myself answering other people's questions on how comfortable it is.",5
"As the bike shop kid said, ""You'll swear at it the first 100 miles, and swear by it every mile after that."" Is it hard?  Yes...at first. Is it 'made' for everybody?  Like anything that has a 'fit,' probably not. I don't keep track of miles, but I've had this for about 8 months [riding 40 minutes each way to work, 5 - 6 days a week] and it began feeling comfortable after about a month and a half.  At first, I had sharp nerve pain on one side, but once the seat position was adjusted that pain went away and never returned. I'm 5'4""-ish [female], average weight and the men's B17 works for me.  I'm more slim-hipped than most women, so it probably wouldn't be for every female.  For me, it's well worth every penny.  I had been using cushy seat covers for years--cheaper in the short term, but they slip and slide plus the gel gets wonky after a few months.  Why not put that time on the bike in custom forming a great leather saddle that [over time] molds to *your* individual bum?",5
"I scored this just as my old Brooks Imperial began to tear. A warehouse deal in a ""damaged package"" meant that it had been opened, and the tension wrench was gone. Oh well. Best saddle for a bike at about the wholesale price? Cha-ching! Not my first Brooks, so I have the wrench already. Looking forward to this one out living the old bike, and being perfectly broken in on the next one. If you have never owned one of these... The beak in process is a big commitment; but super worth it. Easier than wearing wet jeans until they fit IMHO. That's ridiculous. Buy the official Proofhide conditioner, or a good product intended for baseball gloves. Nokona is what I use. Rub it in. Ride it. Add a little more occasionally. Sweating is okay if you keep it conditioned. But don't get leather wet. Rain covers exist. Get one if you commute. That's what ultimately killed my ~7 year old saddle. Don't get them wet. Don't feed them after midnight!",5
"As a young woman, I was an avide bike rider. This was before mountain bikes, century rides, charity ride, and I did this all on a 10 speed road bike..  Fast forward 30 years.  Life prevented me from ridding like I used to.  I was gifted with a bike a few weeks ago after telling numerous people of my plans to support my daughter on her 100 mile run by riiding along the route.  I have never been in such pain in my life with that factory seat.  Not 1 mile passed without my wanting to get off and give up.  Butts are not supposed to hurt like that, so I knew it was the seat.  An acquaintance asked what saddle I used before, and I remembered it was a Brooks leather saddle.  Well he convinced me that is what I needed. While reviews I have read indicated there is 1000 mile break-in period, for me it has been instant relief. My first ride was 4 miles of pure comfort, and each subsequent one has gotten longer and are equally comfortable.  I would recommend this saddle to anyone who plans on logging lots of miles.  Don't let the fact that it is hard  as rock out of the box fool you, it really is a superb seat!",5
"I first bought a Team Pro Imperial  (Honey Brown)  a couple of months ago to replace another saddle I had been using on my Cannondale R1000 road bike.  It felt great from the first time I rode using it.  I treated it per the instructions before installing it on my bike.  With some bar tape to match it has a great vintage look and is very comfortable.  My second ride with it was a mountainous metric century and I finished it with absolutely no discomfort from the saddle! I have been rebuilding an old touring bike and needed a saddle for it.  Since the Team Pro worked so well I decided to order another Brooks saddle.  My only fault (sort of) with the Team Pro is that there are no eyelets nor other good way to tie a tool bag to the seat.  So,  I ordered a B17 Imperial in standard width and brown color.  Dimensions are very similar to the Team Pro but the frame has eyelets for my toolbag.  One of the first things that I noticed is that the leather on the B17 is noticeably thinner than the leather on the Team Pro.  That makes the seat a bit more flexible and I guess it will be ""broken in"" a bit quicker than the other saddle.  As with the first saddle,  it was comfortable from the first time I sat on it.  That makes the break in time a non-issue for me. I am very pleased with both of my Brooks saddles.  They are a bit more comfortable for me than the ""men's anatomic saddles"" that I had been using previously.  There have been no perineal issues for me which can make a huge difference in whether a saddle works for  long hours on the bike or not.  I would not hesitate to buy another one in the future.",5
"I have ridden somewhere north of a half a dozen higher end saddles. Last year the saddle I had purchased really damaged one side of my butt so I decided to finally give this saddle a chance even though I thought I needed one of the fancy aerodynamic racing/endurance saddles. Well, I have to say that this saddle is so much better than any other saddle that I have ridden that I am completely in shock. Not only did the right side of my bum feel much better while on the Brooks saddle but it has actually healed up since I've gotten it. If you want a saddle that is going to treat you right then this is the one, bums down!",5
"I was a bit hesitant at first to buy this saddle. Upon my unboxing, it seemed a but hard. And I even had half the mond to return it. But this has by far been the best addition to my roadbike. I ride it to and from school nearly daily after having bought this but plan on making my roadbike as my main means of transport. What a differemce this B17 Standard saddle has made on my ride. Wow wow wow!!! They say ""only mileage can break this saddle in"" and this is true. But let me tell you I am a 5'2"" female weighing in about 125 measley pounds and it only took 4 rides (roughly 50 miles) before it started feeling cushy!!!! Granted I ride my bike with a backpack stuffed with my laptop and chemistry text book. But it feels amazing after having broken it in! I now prefer my bike to be my choice of transport. I use my car only when I had decided to sleep in a little bit longer. But I cannot stress what a difference this little saddle has made! You won't regret it.",5
"it looks amazing in the light.  it affixed and adjusted MUCH easier that the saddle i had with laces, which was a nightmare.  this is a MENS and i was worried it would be too long.  but, on the bike it is installed, i always found myself pushing back as i pedaled and i ran out of real estate on a WOMANs saddle.  this extra inch in the nose allows me to get in the drops with ease and slide to the back just as quickly.  b/c it's new, it is highly slick and very hard.  but i was not uncomfortable once.  i also noticed that having less width than that of the womans saddle meant i could pedal more naturally, pumping legs up and down much easier.  got to work in record time this morning.  i mistakingly used coconut oil on the leather underside to soften and prematurely break it in, like i have done to other leather saddles without issue.  but it caused the bright red to darken in spots, so am disappointed by that.  still, a refreshing albeit heavy change to the bike commute.  looks so great, i hardly noticed the extra effort needed to hoist the bike up stairs.  this saddle is heavier than the old womans saddle attached to the Thomson seat post!!  haha.  Brooks needs to get titanium under these finely crafted, and near perfect saddles.",4
"The B17 Special is just as comfortable to me as my old saddle, a Team Pro Imperial.  I wanted copper rivets but Brooks does not currently  make an Imperial cut saddle with copper rivets. The B17 Special on right is flatter on top, flares out to the sides more, and sits a little higher than the Team Pro Imperial on left. The leather is initially very dry and will soak up the first application of Proofide.  Compare the darker treated area to the lighter dry area.  It is easier to apply the first treatment of Proofide before you put the saddle on your bicycle. The frame is copper plated except the nose piece.",5
"I was hesitant to pull the trigger on a $90 bike seat but I'm glad I did.  I found it to be comfortable right out of the box and even more so over time.  I've only got about 50 miles on it but it's without a doubt the best saddle I've ever used.  I came from a Selle Italia seat which I liked a lot but after riding the Brooks and switching back I'm not sure how I put so many miles on the Selle.  It feels very rigid but definitely flexes in the right spots when you're sitting on it. The super smooth finish was also something I didn't realize would be so beneficial, basically zero friction no matter what kind of shorts you're wearing.  Of course, you've got to get the angle right or you'll slide forward/back a lot. I wasn't a fan of the old school look on a modern bike at first but it's really grown on me.  Hopefully this will be the last saddle I'll need...",5
"As a bigger guy ( 5'11"" 230lbs ) I ride about 200 miles per week and am always looking to ride longer. I have tried a fair amount of saddles including the super fancy selle italia flite gel flow max which was OK for about a year. After about 3000 miles, it started to hurt more and more despite my weight dropping and extensive seat time. I have always heard these saddles were the most comfortable so I took the risk and IT WAS THE GREATEST CHOICE OF MY LIFE! From the first moment, there was a huge comfort increase. It felt like I was sitting on the sofa. On the first day, I rode it for 30 miles with no padded shorts to help break it in (Which was super comfortable) then the next day I rode 102 miles with padded shorts.

Buy the official Proofhide conditioner, or a good product intended for baseball gloves. Nokona is what I use. Rub it in. Ride it. Add a little more occasionally. Sweating is okay if you keep it conditioned. But don't get leather wet. Rain covers exist. Get one if you commute. That's what ultimately killed my ~7 year old saddle. Don't get them wet. Don't feed them after midnight!",5
"As a young woman, I was an avide bike rider. This was before mountain bikes, century rides, charity ride, and I did this all on a 10 speed road bike..  Fast forward 30 years.  Life prevented me from ridding like I used to.  I was gifted with a bike a few weeks ago after telling numerous people of my plans to support my daughter on her 100 mile run by riiding along the route.  I have never been in such pain in my life with that factory seat.  Not 1 mile passed without my wanting to get off and give up.  Butts are not supposed to hurt like that, so I knew it was the seat.  An acquaintance asked what saddle I used before, and I remembered it was a Brooks leather saddle.  Well he convinced me that is what I needed. While reviews I have read indicated there is 1000 mile break-in period, for me it has been instant relief. My first ride was 4 miles of pure comfort, and each subsequent one has gotten longer and are equally comfortable.  I would recommend this saddle to anyone who plans on logging lots of miles.  Don't let the fact that it is hard  as rock out of the box fool you, it really is a superb seat!",5
"I first bought a Team Pro Imperial  (Honey Brown)  a couple of months ago to replace another saddle I had been using on my Cannondale R1000 road bike.  It felt great from the first time I rode using it.  I treated it per the instructions before installing it on my bike.  With some bar tape to match it has a great vintage look and is very comfortable.  My second ride with it was a mountainous metric century and I finished it with absolutely no discomfort from the saddle! I have been rebuilding an old touring bike and needed a saddle for it.  Since the Team Pro worked so well I decided to order another Brooks saddle.  My only fault (sort of) with the Team Pro is that there are no eyelets nor other good way to tie a tool bag to the seat.  So,  I ordered a B17 Imperial in standard width and brown color.  Dimensions are very similar to the Team Pro but the frame has eyelets for my toolbag.  One of the first things that I noticed is that the leather on the B17 is noticeably thinner than the leather on the Team Pro.  That makes the seat a bit more flexible and I guess it will be ""broken in"" a bit quicker than the other saddle.  As with the first saddle,  it was comfortable from the first time I sat on it.  That makes the break in time a non-issue for me. I am very pleased with both of my Brooks saddles.  They are a bit more comfortable for me than the ""men's anatomic saddles"" that I had been using previously.  There have been no perineal issues for me which can make a huge difference in whether a saddle works for  long hours on the bike or not.  I would not hesitate to buy another one in the future.",5
"I have ridden somewhere north of a half a dozen higher end saddles. Last year the saddle I had purchased really damaged one side of my butt so I decided to finally give this saddle a chance even though I thought I needed one of the fancy aerodynamic racing/endurance saddles. Well, I have to say that this saddle is so much better than any other saddle that I have ridden that I am completely in shock. Not only did the right side of my bum feel much better while on the Brooks saddle but it has actually healed up since I've gotten it. If you want a saddle that is going to treat you right then this is the one, bums down!",5
"I was a bit hesitant at first to buy this saddle. Upon my unboxing, it seemed a but hard. And I even had half the mond to return it. But this has by far been the best addition to my roadbike. I ride it to and from school nearly daily after having bought this but plan on making my roadbike as my main means of transport. What a differemce this B17 Standard saddle has made on my ride. Wow wow wow!!! They say ""only mileage can break this saddle in"" and this is true. But let me tell you I am a 5'2"" female weighing in about 125 measley pounds and it only took 4 rides (roughly 50 miles) before it started feeling cushy!!!! Granted I ride my bike with a backpack stuffed with my laptop and chemistry text book. But it feels amazing after having broken it in! I now prefer my bike to be my choice of transport. I use my car only when I had decided to sleep in a little bit longer. But I cannot stress what a difference this little saddle has made! You won't regret it.",5
"it looks amazing in the light.  it affixed and adjusted MUCH easier that the saddle i had with laces, which was a nightmare.  this is a MENS and i was worried it would be too long.  but, on the bike it is installed, i always found myself pushing back as i pedaled and i ran out of real estate on a WOMANs saddle.  this extra inch in the nose allows me to get in the drops with ease and slide to the back just as quickly.  b/c it's new, it is highly slick and very hard.  but i was not uncomfortable once.  i also noticed that having less width than that of the womans saddle meant i could pedal more naturally, pumping legs up and down much easier.  got to work in record time this morning.  i mistakingly used coconut oil on the leather underside to soften and prematurely break it in, like i have done to other leather saddles without issue.  but it caused the bright red to darken in spots, so am disappointed by that.  still, a refreshing albeit heavy change to the bike commute.  looks so great, i hardly noticed the extra effort needed to hoist the bike up stairs.  this saddle is heavier than the old womans saddle attached to the Thomson seat post!!  haha.  Brooks needs to get titanium under these finely crafted, and near perfect saddles.",4
"The B17 Special is just as comfortable to me as my old saddle, a Team Pro Imperial.  I wanted copper rivets but Brooks does not currently  make an Imperial cut saddle with copper rivets. The B17 Special on right is flatter on top, flares out to the sides more, and sits a little higher than the Team Pro Imperial on left. The leather is initially very dry and will soak up the first application of Proofide.  Compare the darker treated area to the lighter dry area.  It is easier to apply the first treatment of Proofide before you put the saddle on your bicycle. The frame is copper plated except the nose piece.",5
"I was hesitant to pull the trigger on a $90 bike seat but I'm glad I did.  I found it to be comfortable right out of the box and even more so over time.  I've only got about 50 miles on it but it's without a doubt the best saddle I've ever used.  I came from a Selle Italia seat which I liked a lot but after riding the Brooks and switching back I'm not sure how I put so many miles on the Selle.  It feels very rigid but definitely flexes in the right spots when you're sitting on it. The super smooth finish was also something I didn't realize would be so beneficial, basically zero friction no matter what kind of shorts you're wearing.  Of course, you've got to get the angle right or you'll slide forward/back a lot. I wasn't a fan of the old school look on a modern bike at first but it's really grown on me.  Hopefully this will be the last saddle I'll need...",5
"As a bigger guy ( 5'11"" 230lbs ) I ride about 200 miles per week and am always looking to ride longer. I have tried a fair amount of saddles including the super fancy selle italia flite gel flow max which was OK for about a year. After about 3000 miles, it started to hurt more and more despite my weight dropping and extensive seat time. I have always heard these saddles were the most comfortable so I took the risk and IT WAS THE GREATEST CHOICE OF MY LIFE! From the first moment, there was a huge comfort increase. It felt like I was sitting on the sofa. On the first day, I rode it for 30 miles with no padded shorts to help break it in (Which was super comfortable) then the next day I rode 102 miles with padded shorts. The century was the most comfortable I have ever been on a bike and it is getting better. I wish I had bought this in the very beginning instead of looking for the sleek saddles that hurt. I have already gotten multiple compliments on its cools looks and find myself answering other people's questions on how comfortable it is.",5
"As the bike shop kid said, ""You'll swear at it the first 100 miles, and swear by it every mile after that."" Is it hard?  Yes...at first. Is it 'made' for everybody?  Like anything that has a 'fit,' probably not. I don't keep track of miles, but I've had this for about 8 months [riding 40 minutes each way to work, 5 - 6 days a week] and it began feeling comfortable after about a month and a half.  At first, I had sharp nerve pain on one side, but once the seat position was adjusted that pain went away and never returned. I'm 5'4""-ish [female], average weight and the men's B17 works for me.  I'm more slim-hipped than most women, so it probably wouldn't be for every female.  For me, it's well worth every penny.  I had been using cushy seat covers for years--cheaper in the short term, but they slip and slide plus the gel gets wonky after a few months.  Why not put that time on the bike in custom forming a great leather saddle that [over time] molds to *your* individual bum?",5
"I scored this just as my old Brooks Imperial began to tear. A warehouse deal in a ""damaged package"" meant that it had been opened, and the tension wrench was gone. Oh well. Best saddle for a bike at about the wholesale price? Cha-ching! Not my first Brooks, so I have the wrench already.

My second ride with it was a mountainous metric century and I finished it with absolutely no discomfort from the saddle! I have been rebuilding an old touring bike and needed a saddle for it.  Since the Team Pro worked so well I decided to order another Brooks saddle.  My only fault (sort of) with the Team Pro is that there are no eyelets nor other good way to tie a tool bag to the seat.  So,  I ordered a B17 Imperial in standard width and brown color.  Dimensions are very similar to the Team Pro but the frame has eyelets for my toolbag.  One of the first things that I noticed is that the leather on the B17 is noticeably thinner than the leather on the Team Pro.  That makes the seat a bit more flexible and I guess it will be ""broken in"" a bit quicker than the other saddle.  As with the first saddle,  it was comfortable from the first time I sat on it.  That makes the break in time a non-issue for me. I am very pleased with both of my Brooks saddles.  They are a bit more comfortable for me than the ""men's anatomic saddles"" that I had been using previously.  There have been no perineal issues for me which can make a huge difference in whether a saddle works for  long hours on the bike or not.  I would not hesitate to buy another one in the future.",5
"I have ridden somewhere north of a half a dozen higher end saddles. Last year the saddle I had purchased really damaged one side of my butt so I decided to finally give this saddle a chance even though I thought I needed one of the fancy aerodynamic racing/endurance saddles. Well, I have to say that this saddle is so much better than any other saddle that I have ridden that I am completely in shock. Not only did the right side of my bum feel much better while on the Brooks saddle but it has actually healed up since I've gotten it. If you want a saddle that is going to treat you right then this is the one, bums down!",5
"I was a bit hesitant at first to buy this saddle. Upon my unboxing, it seemed a but hard. And I even had half the mond to return it. But this has by far been the best addition to my roadbike. I ride it to and from school nearly daily after having bought this but plan on making my roadbike as my main means of transport. What a differemce this B17 Standard saddle has made on my ride. Wow wow wow!!! They say ""only mileage can break this saddle in"" and this is true. But let me tell you I am a 5'2"" female weighing in about 125 measley pounds and it only took 4 rides (roughly 50 miles) before it started feeling cushy!!!! Granted I ride my bike with a backpack stuffed with my laptop and chemistry text book. But it feels amazing after having broken it in! I now prefer my bike to be my choice of transport. I use my car only when I had decided to sleep in a little bit longer. But I cannot stress what a difference this little saddle has made! You won't regret it.",5
"it looks amazing in the light.  it affixed and adjusted MUCH easier that the saddle i had with laces, which was a nightmare.  this is a MENS and i was worried it would be too long.  but, on the bike it is installed, i always found myself pushing back as i pedaled and i ran out of real estate on a WOMANs saddle.  this extra inch in the nose allows me to get in the drops with ease and slide to the back just as quickly.  b/c it's new, it is highly slick and very hard.  but i was not uncomfortable once.  i also noticed that having less width than that of the womans saddle meant i could pedal more naturally, pumping legs up and down much easier.  got to work in record time this morning.  i mistakingly used coconut oil on the leather underside to soften and prematurely break it in, like i have done to other leather saddles without issue.  but it caused the bright red to darken in spots, so am disappointed by that.  still, a refreshing albeit heavy change to the bike commute.  looks so great, i hardly noticed the extra effort needed to hoist the bike up stairs.  this saddle is heavier than the old womans saddle attached to the Thomson seat post!!  haha.  Brooks needs to get titanium under these finely crafted, and near perfect saddles.",4
"The B17 Special is just as comfortable to me as my old saddle, a Team Pro Imperial.  I wanted copper rivets but Brooks does not currently  make an Imperial cut saddle with copper rivets. The B17 Special on right is flatter on top, flares out to the sides more, and sits a little higher than the Team Pro Imperial on left. The leather is initially very dry and will soak up the first application of Proofide.  Compare the darker treated area to the lighter dry area.  It is easier to apply the first treatment of Proofide before you put the saddle on your bicycle. The frame is copper plated except the nose piece.",5
"I was hesitant to pull the trigger on a $90 bike seat but I'm glad I did.  I found it to be comfortable right out of the box and even more so over time.  I've only got about 50 miles on it but it's without a doubt the best saddle I've ever used.  I came from a Selle Italia seat which I liked a lot but after riding the Brooks and switching back I'm not sure how I put so many miles on the Selle.  It feels very rigid but definitely flexes in the right spots when you're sitting on it. The super smooth finish was also something I didn't realize would be so beneficial, basically zero friction no matter what kind of shorts you're wearing.  Of course, you've got to get the angle right or you'll slide forward/back a lot. I wasn't a fan of the old school look on a modern bike at first but it's really grown on me.  Hopefully this will be the last saddle I'll need...",5
"As a bigger guy ( 5'11"" 230lbs ) I ride about 200 miles per week and am always looking to ride longer. I have tried a fair amount of saddles including the super fancy selle italia flite gel flow max which was OK for about a year. After about 3000 miles, it started to hurt more and more despite my weight dropping and extensive seat time. I have always heard these saddles were the most comfortable so I took the risk and IT WAS THE GREATEST CHOICE OF MY LIFE! From the first moment, there was a huge comfort increase. It felt like I was sitting on the sofa. On the first day, I rode it for 30 miles with no padded shorts to help break it in (Which was super comfortable) then the next day I rode 102 miles with padded shorts. The century was the most comfortable I have ever been on a bike and it is getting better. I wish I had bought this in the very beginning instead of looking for the sleek saddles that hurt. I have already gotten multiple compliments on its cools looks and find myself answering other people's questions on how comfortable it is.",5
"As the bike shop kid said, ""You'll swear at it the first 100 miles, and swear by it every mile after that."" Is it hard?  Yes...at first. Is it 'made' for everybody?  Like anything that has a 'fit,' probably not. I don't keep track of miles, but I've had this for about 8 months [riding 40 minutes each way to work, 5 - 6 days a week] and it began feeling comfortable after about a month and a half.  At first, I had sharp nerve pain on one side, but once the seat position was adjusted that pain went away and never returned. I'm 5'4""-ish [female], average weight and the men's B17 works for me.  I'm more slim-hipped than most women, so it probably wouldn't be for every female.  For me, it's well worth every penny.  I had been using cushy seat covers for years--cheaper in the short term, but they slip and slide plus the gel gets wonky after a few months.  Why not put that time on the bike in custom forming a great leather saddle that [over time] molds to *your* individual bum?",5
"I scored this just as my old Brooks Imperial began to tear. A warehouse deal in a ""damaged package"" meant that it had been opened, and the tension wrench was gone. Oh well. Best saddle for a bike at about the wholesale price? Cha-ching! Not my first Brooks, so I have the wrench already. Looking forward to this one out living the old bike, and being perfectly broken in on the next one. If you have never owned one of these... The beak in process is a big commitment; but super worth it. Easier than wearing wet jeans until they fit IMHO. That's ridiculous. Buy the official Proofhide conditioner, or a good product intended for baseball gloves. Nokona is what I use. Rub it in. Ride it. Add a little more occasionally. Sweating is okay if you keep it conditioned. But don't get leather wet. Rain covers exist. Get one if you commute. That's what ultimately killed my ~7 year old saddle. Don't get them wet. Don't feed them after midnight!",5
"As a young woman, I was an avide bike rider. This was before mountain bikes, century rides, charity ride, and I did this all on a 10 speed road bike..  Fast forward 30 years.  Life prevented me from ridding like I used to.  I was gifted with a bike a few weeks ago after telling numerous people of my plans to support my daughter on her 100 mile run by riiding along the route.  I have never been in such pain in my life with that factory seat.  Not 1 mile passed without my wanting to get off and give up.  Butts are not supposed to hurt like that, so I knew it was the seat.  An acquaintance asked what saddle I used before, and I remembered it was a Brooks leather saddle.  Well he convinced me that is what I needed. While reviews I have read indicated there is 1000 mile break-in period, for me it has been instant relief. My first ride was 4 miles of pure comfort, and each subsequent one has gotten longer and are equally comfortable.  I would recommend this saddle to anyone who plans on logging lots of miles.  Don't let the fact that it is hard  as rock out of the box fool you, it really is a superb seat!",5

"I was a bit hesitant at first to buy this saddle. Upon my unboxing, it seemed a but hard. And I even had half the mond to return it. But this has by far been the best addition to my roadbike. I ride it to and from school nearly daily after having bought this but plan on making my roadbike as my main means of transport. What a differemce this B17 Standard saddle has made on my ride. Wow wow wow!!! They say ""only mileage can break this saddle in"" and this is true. But let me tell you I am a 5'2"" female weighing in about 125 measley pounds and it only took 4 rides (roughly 50 miles) before it started feeling cushy!!!! Granted I ride my bike with a backpack stuffed with my laptop and chemistry text book. But it feels amazing after having broken it in! I now prefer my bike to be my choice of transport. I use my car only when I had decided to sleep in a little bit longer. But I cannot stress what a difference this little saddle has made! You won't regret it.",5
"it looks amazing in the light.  it affixed and adjusted MUCH easier that the saddle i had with laces, which was a nightmare.  this is a MENS and i was worried it would be too long.  but, on the bike it is installed, i always found myself pushing back as i pedaled and i ran out of real estate on a WOMANs saddle.  this extra inch in the nose allows me to get in the drops with ease and slide to the back just as quickly.  b/c it's new, it is highly slick and very hard.  but i was not uncomfortable once.  i also noticed that having less width than that of the womans saddle meant i could pedal more naturally, pumping legs up and down much easier.  got to work in record time this morning.  i mistakingly used coconut oil on the leather underside to soften and prematurely break it in, like i have done to other leather saddles without issue.  but it caused the bright red to darken in spots, so am disappointed by that.  still, a refreshing albeit heavy change to the bike commute.  looks so great, i hardly noticed the extra effort needed to hoist the bike up stairs.  this saddle is heavier than the old womans saddle attached to the Thomson seat post!!  haha.  Brooks needs to get titanium under these finely crafted, and near perfect saddles.",4
"The B17 Special is just as comfortable to me as my old saddle, a Team Pro Imperial.  I wanted copper rivets but Brooks does not currently  make an Imperial cut saddle with copper rivets. The B17 Special on right is flatter on top, flares out to the sides more, and sits a little higher than the Team Pro Imperial on left. The leather is initially very dry and will soak up the first application of Proofide.  Compare the darker treated area to the lighter dry area.  It is easier to apply the first treatment of Proofide before you put the saddle on your bicycle. The frame is copper plated except the nose piece.",5
"I was hesitant to pull the trigger on a $90 bike seat but I'm glad I did.  I found it to be comfortable right out of the box and even more so over time.  I've only got about 50 miles on it but it's without a doubt the best saddle I've ever used.  I came from a Selle Italia seat which I liked a lot but after riding the Brooks and switching back I'm not sure how I put so many miles on the Selle.  It feels very rigid but definitely flexes in the right spots when you're sitting on it. The super smooth finish was also something I didn't realize would be so beneficial, basically zero friction no matter what kind of shorts you're wearing.  Of course, you've got to get the angle right or you'll slide forward/back a lot. I wasn't a fan of the old school look on a modern bike at first but it's really grown on me.  Hopefully this will be the last saddle I'll need...",5
"As a bigger guy ( 5'11"" 230lbs ) I ride about 200 miles per week and am always looking to ride longer. I have tried a fair amount of saddles including the super fancy selle italia flite gel flow max which was OK for about a year. After about 3000 miles, it started to hurt more and more despite my weight dropping and extensive seat time. I have always heard these saddles were the most comfortable so I took the risk and IT WAS THE GREATEST CHOICE OF MY LIFE! From the first moment, there was a huge comfort increase. It felt like I was sitting on the sofa. On the first day, I rode it for 30 miles with no padded shorts to help break it in (Which was super comfortable) then the next day I rode 102 miles with padded shorts. The century was the most comfortable I have ever been on a bike and it is getting better. I wish I had bought this in the very beginning instead of looking for the sleek saddles that hurt. I have already gotten multiple compliments on its cools looks and find myself answering other people's questions on how comfortable it is.",5
"As the bike shop kid said, ""You'll swear at it the first 100 miles, and swear by it every mile after that."" Is it hard?  Yes...at first. Is it 'made' for everybody?  Like anything that has a 'fit,' probably not. I don't keep track of miles, but I've had this for about 8 months [riding 40 minutes each way to work, 5 - 6 days a week] and it began feeling comfortable after about a month and a half.  At first, I had sharp nerve pain on one side, but once the seat position was adjusted that pain went away and never returned. I'm 5'4""-ish [female], average weight and the men's B17 works for me.  I'm more slim-hipped than most women, so it probably wouldn't be for every female.  For me, it's well worth every penny.  I had been using cushy seat covers for years--cheaper in the short term, but they slip and slide plus the gel gets wonky after a few months.  Why not put that time on the bike in custom forming a great leather saddle that [over time] molds to *your* individual bum?",5
"I scored this just as my old Brooks Imperial began to tear. A warehouse deal in a ""damaged package"" meant that it had been opened, and the tension wrench was gone. Oh well. Best saddle for a bike at about the wholesale price? Cha-ching! Not my first Brooks, so I have the wrench already. Looking forward to this one out living the old bike, and being perfectly broken in on the next one. If you have never owned one of these... The beak in process is a big commitment; but super worth it. Easier than wearing wet jeans until they fit IMHO. That's ridiculous. Buy the official Proofhide conditioner, or a good product intended for baseball gloves. Nokona is what I use. Rub it in. Ride it. Add a little more occasionally. Sweating is okay if you keep it conditioned. But don't get leather wet. Rain covers exist. Get one if you commute. That's what ultimately killed my ~7 year old saddle. Don't get them wet. Don't feed them after midnight!",5
"As a young woman, I was an avide bike rider. This was before mountain bikes, century rides, charity ride, and I did this all on a 10 speed road bike..  Fast forward 30 years.  Life prevented me from ridding like I used to.  I was gifted with a bike a few weeks ago after telling numerous people of my plans to support my daughter on her 100 mile run by riiding along the route.  I have never been in such pain in my life with that factory seat.  Not 1 mile passed without my wanting to get off and give up.  Butts are not supposed to hurt like that, so I knew it was the seat.  An acquaintance asked what saddle I used before, and I remembered it was a Brooks leather saddle.  Well he convinced me that is what I needed. While reviews I have read indicated there is 1000 mile break-in period, for me it has been instant relief. My first ride was 4 miles of pure comfort, and each subsequent one has gotten longer and are equally comfortable.  I would recommend this saddle to anyone who plans on logging lots of miles.  Don't let the fact that it is hard  as rock out of the box fool you, it really is a superb seat!",5
"I first bought a Team Pro Imperial  (Honey Brown)  a couple of months ago to replace another saddle I had been using on my Cannondale R1000 road bike.  It felt great from the first time I rode using it.  I treated it per the instructions before installing it on my bike.  With some bar tape to match it has a great vintage look and is very comfortable.  My second ride with it was a mountainous metric century and I finished it with absolutely no discomfort from the saddle! I have been rebuilding an old touring bike and needed a saddle for it.  Since the Team Pro worked so well I decided to order another Brooks saddle.  My only fault (sort of) with the Team Pro is that there are no eyelets nor other good way to tie a tool bag to the seat.  So,  I ordered a B17 Imperial in standard width and brown color.  Dimensions are very similar to the Team Pro but the frame has eyelets for my toolbag.  One of the first things that I noticed is that the leather on the B17 is noticeably thinner than the leather on the Team Pro.  That makes the seat a bit more flexible and I guess it will be ""broken in"" a bit quicker than the other saddle.  As with the first saddle,  it was comfortable from the first time I sat on it.  That makes the break in time a non-issue for me. I am very pleased with both of my Brooks saddles.  They are a bit more comfortable for me than the ""men's anatomic saddles"" that I had been using previously.  There have been no perineal issues for me which can make a huge difference in whether a saddle works for  long hours on the bike or not.  I would not hesitate to buy another one in the future.",5
"I have ridden somewhere north of a half a dozen higher end saddles. Last year the saddle I had purchased really damaged one side of my butt so I decided to finally give this saddle a chance even though I thought I needed one of the fancy aerodynamic racing/endurance saddles.

"it looks amazing in the light.  it affixed and adjusted MUCH easier that the saddle i had with laces, which was a nightmare.  this is a MENS and i was worried it would be too long.  but, on the bike it is installed, i always found myself pushing back as i pedaled and i ran out of real estate on a WOMANs saddle.  this extra inch in the nose allows me to get in the drops with ease and slide to the back just as quickly.  b/c it's new, it is highly slick and very hard.  but i was not uncomfortable once.  i also noticed that having less width than that of the womans saddle meant i could pedal more naturally, pumping legs up and down much easier.  got to work in record time this morning.  i mistakingly used coconut oil on the leather underside to soften and prematurely break it in, like i have done to other leather saddles without issue.  but it caused the bright red to darken in spots, so am disappointed by that.  still, a refreshing albeit heavy change to the bike commute.  looks so great, i hardly noticed the extra effort needed to hoist the bike up stairs.  this saddle is heavier than the old womans saddle attached to the Thomson seat post!!  haha.  Brooks needs to get titanium under these finely crafted, and near perfect saddles.",4
"The B17 Special is just as comfortable to me as my old saddle, a Team Pro Imperial.  I wanted copper rivets but Brooks does not currently  make an Imperial cut saddle with copper rivets. The B17 Special on right is flatter on top, flares out to the sides more, and sits a little higher than the Team Pro Imperial on left. The leather is initially very dry and will soak up the first application of Proofide.  Compare the darker treated area to the lighter dry area.  It is easier to apply the first treatment of Proofide before you put the saddle on your bicycle. The frame is copper plated except the nose piece.",5
"I was hesitant to pull the trigger on a $90 bike seat but I'm glad I did.  I found it to be comfortable right out of the box and even more so over time.  I've only got about 50 miles on it but it's without a doubt the best saddle I've ever used.  I came from a Selle Italia seat which I liked a lot but after riding the Brooks and switching back I'm not sure how I put so many miles on the Selle.  It feels very rigid but definitely flexes in the right spots when you're sitting on it. The super smooth finish was also something I didn't realize would be so beneficial, basically zero friction no matter what kind of shorts you're wearing.  Of course, you've got to get the angle right or you'll slide forward/back a lot. I wasn't a fan of the old school look on a modern bike at first but it's really grown on me.  Hopefully this will be the last saddle I'll need...",5
"As a bigger guy ( 5'11"" 230lbs ) I ride about 200 miles per week and am always looking to ride longer. I have tried a fair amount of saddles including the super fancy selle italia flite gel flow max which was OK for about a year. After about 3000 miles, it started to hurt more and more despite my weight dropping and extensive seat time. I have always heard these saddles were the most comfortable so I took the risk and IT WAS THE GREATEST CHOICE OF MY LIFE! From the first moment, there was a huge comfort increase. It felt like I was sitting on the sofa. On the first day, I rode it for 30 miles with no padded shorts to help break it in (Which was super comfortable) then the next day I rode 102 miles with padded shorts. The century was the most comfortable I have ever been on a bike and it is getting better. I wish I had bought this in the very beginning instead of looking for the sleek saddles that hurt. I have already gotten multiple compliments on its cools looks and find myself answering other people's questions on how comfortable it is.",5
"As the bike shop kid said, ""You'll swear at it the first 100 miles, and swear by it every mile after that."" Is it hard?  Yes...at first. Is it 'made' for everybody?  Like anything that has a 'fit,' probably not. I don't keep track of miles, but I've had this for about 8 months [riding 40 minutes each way to work, 5 - 6 days a week] and it began feeling comfortable after about a month and a half.  At first, I had sharp nerve pain on one side, but once the seat position was adjusted that pain went away and never returned. I'm 5'4""-ish [female], average weight and the men's B17 works for me.  I'm more slim-hipped than most women, so it probably wouldn't be for every female.  For me, it's well worth every penny.  I had been using cushy seat covers for years--cheaper in the short term, but they slip and slide plus the gel gets wonky after a few months.  Why not put that time on the bike in custom forming a great leather saddle that [over time] molds to *your* individual bum?",5
"I scored this just as my old Brooks Imperial began to tear. A warehouse deal in a ""damaged package"" meant that it had been opened, and the tension wrench was gone. Oh well. Best saddle for a bike at about the wholesale price? Cha-ching! Not my first Brooks, so I have the wrench already. Looking forward to this one out living the old bike, and being perfectly broken in on the next one. If you have never owned one of these... The beak in process is a big commitment; but super worth it. Easier than wearing wet jeans until they fit IMHO. That's ridiculous. Buy the official Proofhide conditioner, or a good product intended for baseball gloves. Nokona is what I use. Rub it in. Ride it. Add a little more occasionally. Sweating is okay if you keep it conditioned. But don't get leather wet. Rain covers exist. Get one if you commute. That's what ultimately killed my ~7 year old saddle. Don't get them wet. Don't feed them after midnight!",5
"As a young woman, I was an avide bike rider. This was before mountain bikes, century rides, charity ride, and I did this all on a 10 speed road bike..  Fast forward 30 years.  Life prevented me from ridding like I used to.  I was gifted with a bike a few weeks ago after telling numerous people of my plans to support my daughter on her 100 mile run by riiding along the route.  I have never been in such pain in my life with that factory seat.  Not 1 mile passed without my wanting to get off and give up.  Butts are not supposed to hurt like that, so I knew it was the seat.  An acquaintance asked what saddle I used before, and I remembered it was a Brooks leather saddle.  Well he convinced me that is what I needed. While reviews I have read indicated there is 1000 mile break-in period, for me it has been instant relief. My first ride was 4 miles of pure comfort, and each subsequent one has gotten longer and are equally comfortable.  I would recommend this saddle to anyone who plans on logging lots of miles.  Don't let the fact that it is hard  as rock out of the box fool you, it really is a superb seat!",5
"I first bought a Team Pro Imperial  (Honey Brown)  a couple of months ago to replace another saddle I had been using on my Cannondale R1000 road bike.  It felt great from the first time I rode using it.  I treated it per the instructions before installing it on my bike.  With some bar tape to match it has a great vintage look and is very comfortable.  My second ride with it was a mountainous metric century and I finished it with absolutely no discomfort from the saddle! I have been rebuilding an old touring bike and needed a saddle for it.  Since the Team Pro worked so well I decided to order another Brooks saddle.  My only fault (sort of) with the Team Pro is that there are no eyelets nor other good way to tie a tool bag to the seat.  So,  I ordered a B17 Imperial in standard width and brown color.  Dimensions are very similar to the Team Pro but the frame has eyelets for my toolbag.  One of the first things that I noticed is that the leather on the B17 is noticeably thinner than the leather on the Team Pro.  That makes the seat a bit more flexible and I guess it will be ""broken in"" a bit quicker than the other saddle.  As with the first saddle,  it was comfortable from the first time I sat on it.  That makes the break in time a non-issue for me. I am very pleased with both of my Brooks saddles.  They are a bit more comfortable for me than the ""men's anatomic saddles"" that I had been using previously.  There have been no perineal issues for me which can make a huge difference in whether a saddle works for  long hours on the bike or not.  I would not hesitate to buy another one in the future.",5
"I have ridden somewhere north of a half a dozen higher end saddles. Last year the saddle I had purchased really damaged one side of my butt so I decided to finally give this saddle a chance even though I thought I needed one of the fancy aerodynamic racing/endurance saddles. Well, I have to say that this saddle is so much better than any other saddle that I have ridden that I am completely in shock. Not only did the right side of my bum feel much better while on the Brooks saddle but it has actually healed up since I've gotten it. If you want a saddle that is going to treat you right then this is the one, bums down!",5
"I was a bit hesitant at first to buy this saddle. Upon my unboxing, it seemed a but hard. And I even had half the mond to return it. But this has by far been the best addition to my roadbike. I ride it to and from school nearly daily after having bought this but plan on making my roadbike as my main means of transport. What a differemce this B17 Standard saddle has made on my ride. Wow wow wow!!! They say ""only mileage can break this saddle in"" and this is true. But let me tell you I am a 5'2"" female weighing in about 125 measley pounds and it only took 4 rides (roughly 50 miles) before it started feeling cushy!!!!

"I was hesitant to pull the trigger on a $90 bike seat but I'm glad I did.  I found it to be comfortable right out of the box and even more so over time.  I've only got about 50 miles on it but it's without a doubt the best saddle I've ever used.  I came from a Selle Italia seat which I liked a lot but after riding the Brooks and switching back I'm not sure how I put so many miles on the Selle.  It feels very rigid but definitely flexes in the right spots when you're sitting on it. The super smooth finish was also something I didn't realize would be so beneficial, basically zero friction no matter what kind of shorts you're wearing.  Of course, you've got to get the angle right or you'll slide forward/back a lot. I wasn't a fan of the old school look on a modern bike at first but it's really grown on me.  Hopefully this will be the last saddle I'll need...",5
"As a bigger guy ( 5'11"" 230lbs ) I ride about 200 miles per week and am always looking to ride longer. I have tried a fair amount of saddles including the super fancy selle italia flite gel flow max which was OK for about a year. After about 3000 miles, it started to hurt more and more despite my weight dropping and extensive seat time. I have always heard these saddles were the most comfortable so I took the risk and IT WAS THE GREATEST CHOICE OF MY LIFE! From the first moment, there was a huge comfort increase. It felt like I was sitting on the sofa. On the first day, I rode it for 30 miles with no padded shorts to help break it in (Which was super comfortable) then the next day I rode 102 miles with padded shorts. The century was the most comfortable I have ever been on a bike and it is getting better. I wish I had bought this in the very beginning instead of looking for the sleek saddles that hurt. I have already gotten multiple compliments on its cools looks and find myself answering other people's questions on how comfortable it is.",5
"As the bike shop kid said, ""You'll swear at it the first 100 miles, and swear by it every mile after that."" Is it hard?  Yes...at first. Is it 'made' for everybody?  Like anything that has a 'fit,' probably not. I don't keep track of miles, but I've had this for about 8 months [riding 40 minutes each way to work, 5 - 6 days a week] and it began feeling comfortable after about a month and a half.  At first, I had sharp nerve pain on one side, but once the seat position was adjusted that pain went away and never returned. I'm 5'4""-ish [female], average weight and the men's B17 works for me.  I'm more slim-hipped than most women, so it probably wouldn't be for every female.  For me, it's well worth every penny.  I had been using cushy seat covers for years--cheaper in the short term, but they slip and slide plus the gel gets wonky after a few months.  Why not put that time on the bike in custom forming a great leather saddle that [over time] molds to *your* individual bum?",5
"I scored this just as my old Brooks Imperial began to tear. A warehouse deal in a ""damaged package"" meant that it had been opened, and the tension wrench was gone. Oh well. Best saddle for a bike at about the wholesale price? Cha-ching! Not my first Brooks, so I have the wrench already. Looking forward to this one out living the old bike, and being perfectly broken in on the next one. If you have never owned one of these... The beak in process is a big commitment; but super worth it. Easier than wearing wet jeans until they fit IMHO. That's ridiculous. Buy the official Proofhide conditioner, or a good product intended for baseball gloves. Nokona is what I use. Rub it in. Ride it. Add a little more occasionally. Sweating is okay if you keep it conditioned. But don't get leather wet. Rain covers exist. Get one if you commute. That's what ultimately killed my ~7 year old saddle. Don't get them wet. Don't feed them after midnight!",5
"As a young woman, I was an avide bike rider. This was before mountain bikes, century rides, charity ride, and I did this all on a 10 speed road bike..  Fast forward 30 years.  Life prevented me from ridding like I used to.  I was gifted with a bike a few weeks ago after telling numerous people of my plans to support my daughter on her 100 mile run by riiding along the route.  I have never been in such pain in my life with that factory seat.  Not 1 mile passed without my wanting to get off and give up.  Butts are not supposed to hurt like that, so I knew it was the seat.  An acquaintance asked what saddle I used before, and I remembered it was a Brooks leather saddle.  Well he convinced me that is what I needed. While reviews I have read indicated there is 1000 mile break-in period, for me it has been instant relief. My first ride was 4 miles of pure comfort, and each subsequent one has gotten longer and are equally comfortable.  I would recommend this saddle to anyone who plans on logging lots of miles.  Don't let the fact that it is hard  as rock out of the box fool you, it really is a superb seat!",5
"I first bought a Team Pro Imperial  (Honey Brown)  a couple of months ago to replace another saddle I had been using on my Cannondale R1000 road bike.  It felt great from the first time I rode using it.  I treated it per the instructions before installing it on my bike.  With some bar tape to match it has a great vintage look and is very comfortable.  My second ride with it was a mountainous metric century and I finished it with absolutely no discomfort from the saddle! I have been rebuilding an old touring bike and needed a saddle for it.  Since the Team Pro worked so well I decided to order another Brooks saddle.  My only fault (sort of) with the Team Pro is that there are no eyelets nor other good way to tie a tool bag to the seat.  So,  I ordered a B17 Imperial in standard width and brown color.  Dimensions are very similar to the Team Pro but the frame has eyelets for my toolbag.  One of the first things that I noticed is that the leather on the B17 is noticeably thinner than the leather on the Team Pro.  That makes the seat a bit more flexible and I guess it will be ""broken in"" a bit quicker than the other saddle.  As with the first saddle,  it was comfortable from the first time I sat on it.  That makes the break in time a non-issue for me. I am very pleased with both of my Brooks saddles.  They are a bit more comfortable for me than the ""men's anatomic saddles"" that I had been using previously.  There have been no perineal issues for me which can make a huge difference in whether a saddle works for  long hours on the bike or not.  I would not hesitate to buy another one in the future.",5
"I have ridden somewhere north of a half a dozen higher end saddles. Last year the saddle I had purchased really damaged one side of my butt so I decided to finally give this saddle a chance even though I thought I needed one of the fancy aerodynamic racing/endurance saddles. Well, I have to say that this saddle is so much better than any other saddle that I have ridden that I am completely in shock. Not only did the right side of my bum feel much better while on the Brooks saddle but it has actually healed up since I've gotten it. If you want a saddle that is going to treat you right then this is the one, bums down!",5
"I was a bit hesitant at first to buy this saddle. Upon my unboxing, it seemed a but hard. And I even had half the mond to return it. But this has by far been the best addition to my roadbike. I ride it to and from school nearly daily after having bought this but plan on making my roadbike as my main means of transport. What a differemce this B17 Standard saddle has made on my ride. Wow wow wow!!! They say ""only mileage can break this saddle in"" and this is true. But let me tell you I am a 5'2"" female weighing in about 125 measley pounds and it only took 4 rides (roughly 50 miles) before it started feeling cushy!!!! Granted I ride my bike with a backpack stuffed with my laptop and chemistry text book. But it feels amazing after having broken it in! I now prefer my bike to be my choice of transport. I use my car only when I had decided to sleep in a little bit longer. But I cannot stress what a difference this little saddle has made! You won't regret it.",5
"it looks amazing in the light.  it affixed and adjusted MUCH easier that the saddle i had with laces, which was a nightmare.  this is a MENS and i was worried it would be too long.  but, on the bike it is installed, i always found myself pushing back as i pedaled and i ran out of real estate on a WOMANs saddle.  this extra inch in the nose allows me to get in the drops with ease and slide to the back just as quickly.  b/c it's new, it is highly slick and very hard.  but i was not uncomfortable once.  i also noticed that having less width than that of the womans saddle meant i could pedal more naturally, pumping legs up and down much easier.  got to work in record time this morning.  i mistakingly used coconut oil on the leather underside to soften and prematurely break it in, like i have done to other leather saddles without issue.  but it caused the bright red to darken in spots, so am disappointed by that.  still, a refreshing albeit heavy change to the bike commute.  looks so great, i hardly noticed the extra effort needed to hoist the bike up stairs.  this saddle is heavier than the old womans saddle attached to the Thomson seat post!!  haha.  Brooks needs to get titanium under these finely crafted, and near perfect saddles.",4
"The B17 Special is just as comfortable to me as my old saddle, a Team Pro Imperial.  I wanted copper rivets but Brooks does not currently  make an Imperial cut saddle with copper rivets. The B17 Special on right is flatter on top, flares out to the sides more, and sits a little higher than the Team Pro Imperial on left.

I have already gotten multiple compliments on its cools looks and find myself answering other people's questions on how comfortable it is.",5
"As the bike shop kid said, ""You'll swear at it the first 100 miles, and swear by it every mile after that."" Is it hard?  Yes...at first. Is it 'made' for everybody?  Like anything that has a 'fit,' probably not. I don't keep track of miles, but I've had this for about 8 months [riding 40 minutes each way to work, 5 - 6 days a week] and it began feeling comfortable after about a month and a half.  At first, I had sharp nerve pain on one side, but once the seat position was adjusted that pain went away and never returned. I'm 5'4""-ish [female], average weight and the men's B17 works for me.  I'm more slim-hipped than most women, so it probably wouldn't be for every female.  For me, it's well worth every penny.  I had been using cushy seat covers for years--cheaper in the short term, but they slip and slide plus the gel gets wonky after a few months.  Why not put that time on the bike in custom forming a great leather saddle that [over time] molds to *your* individual bum?",5
"I scored this just as my old Brooks Imperial began to tear. A warehouse deal in a ""damaged package"" meant that it had been opened, and the tension wrench was gone. Oh well. Best saddle for a bike at about the wholesale price? Cha-ching! Not my first Brooks, so I have the wrench already. Looking forward to this one out living the old bike, and being perfectly broken in on the next one. If you have never owned one of these... The beak in process is a big commitment; but super worth it. Easier than wearing wet jeans until they fit IMHO. That's ridiculous. Buy the official Proofhide conditioner, or a good product intended for baseball gloves. Nokona is what I use. Rub it in. Ride it. Add a little more occasionally. Sweating is okay if you keep it conditioned. But don't get leather wet. Rain covers exist. Get one if you commute. That's what ultimately killed my ~7 year old saddle. Don't get them wet. Don't feed them after midnight!",5
"As a young woman, I was an avide bike rider. This was before mountain bikes, century rides, charity ride, and I did this all on a 10 speed road bike..  Fast forward 30 years.  Life prevented me from ridding like I used to.  I was gifted with a bike a few weeks ago after telling numerous people of my plans to support my daughter on her 100 mile run by riiding along the route.  I have never been in such pain in my life with that factory seat.  Not 1 mile passed without my wanting to get off and give up.  Butts are not supposed to hurt like that, so I knew it was the seat.  An acquaintance asked what saddle I used before, and I remembered it was a Brooks leather saddle.  Well he convinced me that is what I needed. While reviews I have read indicated there is 1000 mile break-in period, for me it has been instant relief. My first ride was 4 miles of pure comfort, and each subsequent one has gotten longer and are equally comfortable.  I would recommend this saddle to anyone who plans on logging lots of miles.  Don't let the fact that it is hard  as rock out of the box fool you, it really is a superb seat!",5
"I first bought a Team Pro Imperial  (Honey Brown)  a couple of months ago to replace another saddle I had been using on my Cannondale R1000 road bike.  It felt great from the first time I rode using it.  I treated it per the instructions before installing it on my bike.  With some bar tape to match it has a great vintage look and is very comfortable.  My second ride with it was a mountainous metric century and I finished it with absolutely no discomfort from the saddle! I have been rebuilding an old touring bike and needed a saddle for it.  Since the Team Pro worked so well I decided to order another Brooks saddle.  My only fault (sort of) with the Team Pro is that there are no eyelets nor other good way to tie a tool bag to the seat.  So,  I ordered a B17 Imperial in standard width and brown color.  Dimensions are very similar to the Team Pro but the frame has eyelets for my toolbag.  One of the first things that I noticed is that the leather on the B17 is noticeably thinner than the leather on the Team Pro.  That makes the seat a bit more flexible and I guess it will be ""broken in"" a bit quicker than the other saddle.  As with the first saddle,  it was comfortable from the first time I sat on it.  That makes the break in time a non-issue for me. I am very pleased with both of my Brooks saddles.  They are a bit more comfortable for me than the ""men's anatomic saddles"" that I had been using previously.  There have been no perineal issues for me which can make a huge difference in whether a saddle works for  long hours on the bike or not.  I would not hesitate to buy another one in the future.",5
"I have ridden somewhere north of a half a dozen higher end saddles. Last year the saddle I had purchased really damaged one side of my butt so I decided to finally give this saddle a chance even though I thought I needed one of the fancy aerodynamic racing/endurance saddles. Well, I have to say that this saddle is so much better than any other saddle that I have ridden that I am completely in shock. Not only did the right side of my bum feel much better while on the Brooks saddle but it has actually healed up since I've gotten it. If you want a saddle that is going to treat you right then this is the one, bums down!",5
"I was a bit hesitant at first to buy this saddle. Upon my unboxing, it seemed a but hard. And I even had half the mond to return it. But this has by far been the best addition to my roadbike. I ride it to and from school nearly daily after having bought this but plan on making my roadbike as my main means of transport. What a differemce this B17 Standard saddle has made on my ride. Wow wow wow!!! They say ""only mileage can break this saddle in"" and this is true. But let me tell you I am a 5'2"" female weighing in about 125 measley pounds and it only took 4 rides (roughly 50 miles) before it started feeling cushy!!!! Granted I ride my bike with a backpack stuffed with my laptop and chemistry text book. But it feels amazing after having broken it in! I now prefer my bike to be my choice of transport. I use my car only when I had decided to sleep in a little bit longer. But I cannot stress what a difference this little saddle has made! You won't regret it.",5
"it looks amazing in the light.  it affixed and adjusted MUCH easier that the saddle i had with laces, which was a nightmare.  this is a MENS and i was worried it would be too long.  but, on the bike it is installed, i always found myself pushing back as i pedaled and i ran out of real estate on a WOMANs saddle.  this extra inch in the nose allows me to get in the drops with ease and slide to the back just as quickly.  b/c it's new, it is highly slick and very hard.  but i was not uncomfortable once.  i also noticed that having less width than that of the womans saddle meant i could pedal more naturally, pumping legs up and down much easier.  got to work in record time this morning.  i mistakingly used coconut oil on the leather underside to soften and prematurely break it in, like i have done to other leather saddles without issue.  but it caused the bright red to darken in spots, so am disappointed by that.  still, a refreshing albeit heavy change to the bike commute.  looks so great, i hardly noticed the extra effort needed to hoist the bike up stairs.  this saddle is heavier than the old womans saddle attached to the Thomson seat post!!  haha.  Brooks needs to get titanium under these finely crafted, and near perfect saddles.",4
"The B17 Special is just as comfortable to me as my old saddle, a Team Pro Imperial.  I wanted copper rivets but Brooks does not currently  make an Imperial cut saddle with copper rivets. The B17 Special on right is flatter on top, flares out to the sides more, and sits a little higher than the Team Pro Imperial on left. The leather is initially very dry and will soak up the first application of Proofide.  Compare the darker treated area to the lighter dry area.  It is easier to apply the first treatment of Proofide before you put the saddle on your bicycle. The frame is copper plated except the nose piece.",5
"I was hesitant to pull the trigger on a $90 bike seat but I'm glad I did.  I found it to be comfortable right out of the box and even more so over time.  I've only got about 50 miles on it but it's without a doubt the best saddle I've ever used.  I came from a Selle Italia seat which I liked a lot but after riding the Brooks and switching back I'm not sure how I put so many miles on the Selle.  It feels very rigid but definitely flexes in the right spots when you're sitting on it. The super smooth finish was also something I didn't realize would be so beneficial, basically zero friction no matter what kind of shorts you're wearing.  Of course, you've got to get the angle right or you'll slide forward/back a lot. I wasn't a fan of the old school look on a modern bike at first but it's really grown on me.  Hopefully this will be the last saddle I'll need...",5
"As a bigger guy ( 5'11"" 230lbs ) I ride about 200 miles per week and am always looking to ride longer. I have tried a fair amount of saddles including the super fancy selle italia flite gel flow max which was OK for about a year. After about 3000 miles, it started to hurt more and more despite my weight dropping and extensive seat time. I have always heard these saddles were the most comfortable so I took the risk and IT WAS THE GREATEST CHOICE OF MY LIFE! From the first moment, there was a huge comfort increase. It felt like I was sitting on the sofa. On the first day, I rode it for 30 miles with no padded shorts to help break it in (Which was super comfortable) then the next day I rode 102 miles with padded shorts.

Buy the official Proofhide conditioner, or a good product intended for baseball gloves. Nokona is what I use. Rub it in. Ride it. Add a little more occasionally. Sweating is okay if you keep it conditioned. But don't get leather wet. Rain covers exist. Get one if you commute. That's what ultimately killed my ~7 year old saddle. Don't get them wet. Don't feed them after midnight!",5
"As a young woman, I was an avide bike rider. This was before mountain bikes, century rides, charity ride, and I did this all on a 10 speed road bike..  Fast forward 30 years.  Life prevented me from ridding like I used to.  I was gifted with a bike a few weeks ago after telling numerous people of my plans to support my daughter on her 100 mile run by riiding along the route.  I have never been in such pain in my life with that factory seat.  Not 1 mile passed without my wanting to get off and give up.  Butts are not supposed to hurt like that, so I knew it was the seat.  An acquaintance asked what saddle I used before, and I remembered it was a Brooks leather saddle.  Well he convinced me that is what I needed. While reviews I have read indicated there is 1000 mile break-in period, for me it has been instant relief. My first ride was 4 miles of pure comfort, and each subsequent one has gotten longer and are equally comfortable.  I would recommend this saddle to anyone who plans on logging lots of miles.  Don't let the fact that it is hard  as rock out of the box fool you, it really is a superb seat!",5
"I first bought a Team Pro Imperial  (Honey Brown)  a couple of months ago to replace another saddle I had been using on my Cannondale R1000 road bike.  It felt great from the first time I rode using it.  I treated it per the instructions before installing it on my bike.  With some bar tape to match it has a great vintage look and is very comfortable.  My second ride with it was a mountainous metric century and I finished it with absolutely no discomfort from the saddle! I have been rebuilding an old touring bike and needed a saddle for it.  Since the Team Pro worked so well I decided to order another Brooks saddle.  My only fault (sort of) with the Team Pro is that there are no eyelets nor other good way to tie a tool bag to the seat.  So,  I ordered a B17 Imperial in standard width and brown color.  Dimensions are very similar to the Team Pro but the frame has eyelets for my toolbag.  One of the first things that I noticed is that the leather on the B17 is noticeably thinner than the leather on the Team Pro.  That makes the seat a bit more flexible and I guess it will be ""broken in"" a bit quicker than the other saddle.  As with the first saddle,  it was comfortable from the first time I sat on it.  That makes the break in time a non-issue for me. I am very pleased with both of my Brooks saddles.  They are a bit more comfortable for me than the ""men's anatomic saddles"" that I had been using previously.  There have been no perineal issues for me which can make a huge difference in whether a saddle works for  long hours on the bike or not.  I would not hesitate to buy another one in the future.",5
"I have ridden somewhere north of a half a dozen higher end saddles. Last year the saddle I had purchased really damaged one side of my butt so I decided to finally give this saddle a chance even though I thought I needed one of the fancy aerodynamic racing/endurance saddles. Well, I have to say that this saddle is so much better than any other saddle that I have ridden that I am completely in shock. Not only did the right side of my bum feel much better while on the Brooks saddle but it has actually healed up since I've gotten it. If you want a saddle that is going to treat you right then this is the one, bums down!",5
"I was a bit hesitant at first to buy this saddle. Upon my unboxing, it seemed a but hard. And I even had half the mond to return it. But this has by far been the best addition to my roadbike. I ride it to and from school nearly daily after having bought this but plan on making my roadbike as my main means of transport. What a differemce this B17 Standard saddle has made on my ride. Wow wow wow!!! They say ""only mileage can break this saddle in"" and this is true. But let me tell you I am a 5'2"" female weighing in about 125 measley pounds and it only took 4 rides (roughly 50 miles) before it started feeling cushy!!!! Granted I ride my bike with a backpack stuffed with my laptop and chemistry text book. But it feels amazing after having broken it in! I now prefer my bike to be my choice of transport. I use my car only when I had decided to sleep in a little bit longer. But I cannot stress what a difference this little saddle has made! You won't regret it.",5
"it looks amazing in the light.  it affixed and adjusted MUCH easier that the saddle i had with laces, which was a nightmare.  this is a MENS and i was worried it would be too long.  but, on the bike it is installed, i always found myself pushing back as i pedaled and i ran out of real estate on a WOMANs saddle.  this extra inch in the nose allows me to get in the drops with ease and slide to the back just as quickly.  b/c it's new, it is highly slick and very hard.  but i was not uncomfortable once.  i also noticed that having less width than that of the womans saddle meant i could pedal more naturally, pumping legs up and down much easier.  got to work in record time this morning.  i mistakingly used coconut oil on the leather underside to soften and prematurely break it in, like i have done to other leather saddles without issue.  but it caused the bright red to darken in spots, so am disappointed by that.  still, a refreshing albeit heavy change to the bike commute.  looks so great, i hardly noticed the extra effort needed to hoist the bike up stairs.  this saddle is heavier than the old womans saddle attached to the Thomson seat post!!  haha.  Brooks needs to get titanium under these finely crafted, and near perfect saddles.",4
"The B17 Special is just as comfortable to me as my old saddle, a Team Pro Imperial.  I wanted copper rivets but Brooks does not currently  make an Imperial cut saddle with copper rivets. The B17 Special on right is flatter on top, flares out to the sides more, and sits a little higher than the Team Pro Imperial on left. The leather is initially very dry and will soak up the first application of Proofide.  Compare the darker treated area to the lighter dry area.  It is easier to apply the first treatment of Proofide before you put the saddle on your bicycle. The frame is copper plated except the nose piece.",5
"I was hesitant to pull the trigger on a $90 bike seat but I'm glad I did.  I found it to be comfortable right out of the box and even more so over time.  I've only got about 50 miles on it but it's without a doubt the best saddle I've ever used.  I came from a Selle Italia seat which I liked a lot but after riding the Brooks and switching back I'm not sure how I put so many miles on the Selle.  It feels very rigid but definitely flexes in the right spots when you're sitting on it. The super smooth finish was also something I didn't realize would be so beneficial, basically zero friction no matter what kind of shorts you're wearing.  Of course, you've got to get the angle right or you'll slide forward/back a lot. I wasn't a fan of the old school look on a modern bike at first but it's really grown on me.  Hopefully this will be the last saddle I'll need...",5
"As a bigger guy ( 5'11"" 230lbs ) I ride about 200 miles per week and am always looking to ride longer. I have tried a fair amount of saddles including the super fancy selle italia flite gel flow max which was OK for about a year. After about 3000 miles, it started to hurt more and more despite my weight dropping and extensive seat time. I have always heard these saddles were the most comfortable so I took the risk and IT WAS THE GREATEST CHOICE OF MY LIFE! From the first moment, there was a huge comfort increase. It felt like I was sitting on the sofa. On the first day, I rode it for 30 miles with no padded shorts to help break it in (Which was super comfortable) then the next day I rode 102 miles with padded shorts. The century was the most comfortable I have ever been on a bike and it is getting better. I wish I had bought this in the very beginning instead of looking for the sleek saddles that hurt. I have already gotten multiple compliments on its cools looks and find myself answering other people's questions on how comfortable it is.",5
"As the bike shop kid said, ""You'll swear at it the first 100 miles, and swear by it every mile after that."" Is it hard?  Yes...at first. Is it 'made' for everybody?  Like anything that has a 'fit,' probably not. I don't keep track of miles, but I've had this for about 8 months [riding 40 minutes each way to work, 5 - 6 days a week] and it began feeling comfortable after about a month and a half.  At first, I had sharp nerve pain on one side, but once the seat position was adjusted that pain went away and never returned. I'm 5'4""-ish [female], average weight and the men's B17 works for me.  I'm more slim-hipped than most women, so it probably wouldn't be for every female.  For me, it's well worth every penny.  I had been using cushy seat covers for years--cheaper in the short term, but they slip and slide plus the gel gets wonky after a few months.  Why not put that time on the bike in custom forming a great leather saddle that [over time] molds to *your* individual bum?",5
"I scored this just as my old Brooks Imperial began to tear. A warehouse deal in a ""damaged package"" meant that it had been opened, and the tension wrench was gone. Oh well. Best saddle for a bike at about the wholesale price? Cha-ching! Not my first Brooks, so I have the wrench already.

My second ride with it was a mountainous metric century and I finished it with absolutely no discomfort from the saddle! I have been rebuilding an old touring bike and needed a saddle for it.  Since the Team Pro worked so well I decided to order another Brooks saddle.  My only fault (sort of) with the Team Pro is that there are no eyelets nor other good way to tie a tool bag to the seat.  So,  I ordered a B17 Imperial in standard width and brown color.  Dimensions are very similar to the Team Pro but the frame has eyelets for my toolbag.  One of the first things that I noticed is that the leather on the B17 is noticeably thinner than the leather on the Team Pro.  That makes the seat a bit more flexible and I guess it will be ""broken in"" a bit quicker than the other saddle.  As with the first saddle,  it was comfortable from the first time I sat on it.  That makes the break in time a non-issue for me. I am very pleased with both of my Brooks saddles.  They are a bit more comfortable for me than the ""men's anatomic saddles"" that I had been using previously.  There have been no perineal issues for me which can make a huge difference in whether a saddle works for  long hours on the bike or not.  I would not hesitate to buy another one in the future.",5
"I have ridden somewhere north of a half a dozen higher end saddles. Last year the saddle I had purchased really damaged one side of my butt so I decided to finally give this saddle a chance even though I thought I needed one of the fancy aerodynamic racing/endurance saddles. Well, I have to say that this saddle is so much better than any other saddle that I have ridden that I am completely in shock. Not only did the right side of my bum feel much better while on the Brooks saddle but it has actually healed up since I've gotten it. If you want a saddle that is going to treat you right then this is the one, bums down!",5
"I was a bit hesitant at first to buy this saddle. Upon my unboxing, it seemed a but hard. And I even had half the mond to return it. But this has by far been the best addition to my roadbike. I ride it to and from school nearly daily after having bought this but plan on making my roadbike as my main means of transport. What a differemce this B17 Standard saddle has made on my ride. Wow wow wow!!! They say ""only mileage can break this saddle in"" and this is true. But let me tell you I am a 5'2"" female weighing in about 125 measley pounds and it only took 4 rides (roughly 50 miles) before it started feeling cushy!!!! Granted I ride my bike with a backpack stuffed with my laptop and chemistry text book. But it feels amazing after having broken it in! I now prefer my bike to be my choice of transport. I use my car only when I had decided to sleep in a little bit longer. But I cannot stress what a difference this little saddle has made! You won't regret it.",5
"it looks amazing in the light.  it affixed and adjusted MUCH easier that the saddle i had with laces, which was a nightmare.  this is a MENS and i was worried it would be too long.  but, on the bike it is installed, i always found myself pushing back as i pedaled and i ran out of real estate on a WOMANs saddle.  this extra inch in the nose allows me to get in the drops with ease and slide to the back just as quickly.  b/c it's new, it is highly slick and very hard.  but i was not uncomfortable once.  i also noticed that having less width than that of the womans saddle meant i could pedal more naturally, pumping legs up and down much easier.  got to work in record time this morning.  i mistakingly used coconut oil on the leather underside to soften and prematurely break it in, like i have done to other leather saddles without issue.  but it caused the bright red to darken in spots, so am disappointed by that.  still, a refreshing albeit heavy change to the bike commute.  looks so great, i hardly noticed the extra effort needed to hoist the bike up stairs.  this saddle is heavier than the old womans saddle attached to the Thomson seat post!!  haha.  Brooks needs to get titanium under these finely crafted, and near perfect saddles.",4
"The B17 Special is just as comfortable to me as my old saddle, a Team Pro Imperial.  I wanted copper rivets but Brooks does not currently  make an Imperial cut saddle with copper rivets. The B17 Special on right is flatter on top, flares out to the sides more, and sits a little higher than the Team Pro Imperial on left. The leather is initially very dry and will soak up the first application of Proofide.  Compare the darker treated area to the lighter dry area.  It is easier to apply the first treatment of Proofide before you put the saddle on your bicycle. The frame is copper plated except the nose piece.",5
"I was hesitant to pull the trigger on a $90 bike seat but I'm glad I did.  I found it to be comfortable right out of the box and even more so over time.  I've only got about 50 miles on it but it's without a doubt the best saddle I've ever used.  I came from a Selle Italia seat which I liked a lot but after riding the Brooks and switching back I'm not sure how I put so many miles on the Selle.  It feels very rigid but definitely flexes in the right spots when you're sitting on it. The super smooth finish was also something I didn't realize would be so beneficial, basically zero friction no matter what kind of shorts you're wearing.  Of course, you've got to get the angle right or you'll slide forward/back a lot. I wasn't a fan of the old school look on a modern bike at first but it's really grown on me.  Hopefully this will be the last saddle I'll need...",5
"As a bigger guy ( 5'11"" 230lbs ) I ride about 200 miles per week and am always looking to ride longer. I have tried a fair amount of saddles including the super fancy selle italia flite gel flow max which was OK for about a year. After about 3000 miles, it started to hurt more and more despite my weight dropping and extensive seat time. I have always heard these saddles were the most comfortable so I took the risk and IT WAS THE GREATEST CHOICE OF MY LIFE! From the first moment, there was a huge comfort increase. It felt like I was sitting on the sofa. On the first day, I rode it for 30 miles with no padded shorts to help break it in (Which was super comfortable) then the next day I rode 102 miles with padded shorts. The century was the most comfortable I have ever been on a bike and it is getting better. I wish I had bought this in the very beginning instead of looking for the sleek saddles that hurt. I have already gotten multiple compliments on its cools looks and find myself answering other people's questions on how comfortable it is.",5
"As the bike shop kid said, ""You'll swear at it the first 100 miles, and swear by it every mile after that."" Is it hard?  Yes...at first. Is it 'made' for everybody?  Like anything that has a 'fit,' probably not. I don't keep track of miles, but I've had this for about 8 months [riding 40 minutes each way to work, 5 - 6 days a week] and it began feeling comfortable after about a month and a half.  At first, I had sharp nerve pain on one side, but once the seat position was adjusted that pain went away and never returned. I'm 5'4""-ish [female], average weight and the men's B17 works for me.  I'm more slim-hipped than most women, so it probably wouldn't be for every female.  For me, it's well worth every penny.  I had been using cushy seat covers for years--cheaper in the short term, but they slip and slide plus the gel gets wonky after a few months.  Why not put that time on the bike in custom forming a great leather saddle that [over time] molds to *your* individual bum?",5
"I scored this just as my old Brooks Imperial began to tear. A warehouse deal in a ""damaged package"" meant that it had been opened, and the tension wrench was gone. Oh well. Best saddle for a bike at about the wholesale price? Cha-ching! Not my first Brooks, so I have the wrench already. Looking forward to this one out living the old bike, and being perfectly broken in on the next one. If you have never owned one of these... The beak in process is a big commitment; but super worth it. Easier than wearing wet jeans until they fit IMHO. That's ridiculous. Buy the official Proofhide conditioner, or a good product intended for baseball gloves. Nokona is what I use. Rub it in. Ride it. Add a little more occasionally. Sweating is okay if you keep it conditioned. But don't get leather wet. Rain covers exist. Get one if you commute. That's what ultimately killed my ~7 year old saddle. Don't get them wet. Don't feed them after midnight!",5
"As a young woman, I was an avide bike rider. This was before mountain bikes, century rides, charity ride, and I did this all on a 10 speed road bike..  Fast forward 30 years.  Life prevented me from ridding like I used to.  I was gifted with a bike a few weeks ago after telling numerous people of my plans to support my daughter on her 100 mile run by riiding along the route.  I have never been in such pain in my life with that factory seat.  Not 1 mile passed without my wanting to get off and give up.  Butts are not supposed to hurt like that, so I knew it was the seat.  An acquaintance asked what saddle I used before, and I remembered it was a Brooks leather saddle.  Well he convinced me that is what I needed. While reviews I have read indicated there is 1000 mile break-in period, for me it has been instant relief. My first ride was 4 miles of pure comfort, and each subsequent one has gotten longer and are equally comfortable.  I would recommend this saddle to anyone who plans on logging lots of miles.  Don't let the fact that it is hard  as rock out of the box fool you, it really is a superb seat!",5

"I was a bit hesitant at first to buy this saddle. Upon my unboxing, it seemed a but hard. And I even had half the mond to return it. But this has by far been the best addition to my roadbike. I ride it to and from school nearly daily after having bought this but plan on making my roadbike as my main means of transport. What a differemce this B17 Standard saddle has made on my ride. Wow wow wow!!! They say ""only mileage can break this saddle in"" and this is true. But let me tell you I am a 5'2"" female weighing in about 125 measley pounds and it only took 4 rides (roughly 50 miles) before it started feeling cushy!!!! Granted I ride my bike with a backpack stuffed with my laptop and chemistry text book. But it feels amazing after having broken it in! I now prefer my bike to be my choice of transport. I use my car only when I had decided to sleep in a little bit longer. But I cannot stress what a difference this little saddle has made! You won't regret it.",5
"it looks amazing in the light.  it affixed and adjusted MUCH easier that the saddle i had with laces, which was a nightmare.  this is a MENS and i was worried it would be too long.  but, on the bike it is installed, i always found myself pushing back as i pedaled and i ran out of real estate on a WOMANs saddle.  this extra inch in the nose allows me to get in the drops with ease and slide to the back just as quickly.  b/c it's new, it is highly slick and very hard.  but i was not uncomfortable once.  i also noticed that having less width than that of the womans saddle meant i could pedal more naturally, pumping legs up and down much easier.  got to work in record time this morning.  i mistakingly used coconut oil on the leather underside to soften and prematurely break it in, like i have done to other leather saddles without issue.  but it caused the bright red to darken in spots, so am disappointed by that.  still, a refreshing albeit heavy change to the bike commute.  looks so great, i hardly noticed the extra effort needed to hoist the bike up stairs.  this saddle is heavier than the old womans saddle attached to the Thomson seat post!!  haha.  Brooks needs to get titanium under these finely crafted, and near perfect saddles.",4
"The B17 Special is just as comfortable to me as my old saddle, a Team Pro Imperial.  I wanted copper rivets but Brooks does not currently  make an Imperial cut saddle with copper rivets. The B17 Special on right is flatter on top, flares out to the sides more, and sits a little higher than the Team Pro Imperial on left. The leather is initially very dry and will soak up the first application of Proofide.  Compare the darker treated area to the lighter dry area.  It is easier to apply the first treatment of Proofide before you put the saddle on your bicycle. The frame is copper plated except the nose piece.",5
"I was hesitant to pull the trigger on a $90 bike seat but I'm glad I did.  I found it to be comfortable right out of the box and even more so over time.  I've only got about 50 miles on it but it's without a doubt the best saddle I've ever used.  I came from a Selle Italia seat which I liked a lot but after riding the Brooks and switching back I'm not sure how I put so many miles on the Selle.  It feels very rigid but definitely flexes in the right spots when you're sitting on it. The super smooth finish was also something I didn't realize would be so beneficial, basically zero friction no matter what kind of shorts you're wearing.  Of course, you've got to get the angle right or you'll slide forward/back a lot. I wasn't a fan of the old school look on a modern bike at first but it's really grown on me.  Hopefully this will be the last saddle I'll need...",5
"As a bigger guy ( 5'11"" 230lbs ) I ride about 200 miles per week and am always looking to ride longer. I have tried a fair amount of saddles including the super fancy selle italia flite gel flow max which was OK for about a year. After about 3000 miles, it started to hurt more and more despite my weight dropping and extensive seat time. I have always heard these saddles were the most comfortable so I took the risk and IT WAS THE GREATEST CHOICE OF MY LIFE! From the first moment, there was a huge comfort increase. It felt like I was sitting on the sofa. On the first day, I rode it for 30 miles with no padded shorts to help break it in (Which was super comfortable) then the next day I rode 102 miles with padded shorts. The century was the most comfortable I have ever been on a bike and it is getting better. I wish I had bought this in the very beginning instead of looking for the sleek saddles that hurt. I have already gotten multiple compliments on its cools looks and find myself answering other people's questions on how comfortable it is.",5
"As the bike shop kid said, ""You'll swear at it the first 100 miles, and swear by it every mile after that."" Is it hard?  Yes...at first. Is it 'made' for everybody?  Like anything that has a 'fit,' probably not. I don't keep track of miles, but I've had this for about 8 months [riding 40 minutes each way to work, 5 - 6 days a week] and it began feeling comfortable after about a month and a half.  At first, I had sharp nerve pain on one side, but once the seat position was adjusted that pain went away and never returned. I'm 5'4""-ish [female], average weight and the men's B17 works for me.  I'm more slim-hipped than most women, so it probably wouldn't be for every female.  For me, it's well worth every penny.  I had been using cushy seat covers for years--cheaper in the short term, but they slip and slide plus the gel gets wonky after a few months.  Why not put that time on the bike in custom forming a great leather saddle that [over time] molds to *your* individual bum?",5
"I scored this just as my old Brooks Imperial began to tear. A warehouse deal in a ""damaged package"" meant that it had been opened, and the tension wrench was gone. Oh well. Best saddle for a bike at about the wholesale price? Cha-ching! Not my first Brooks, so I have the wrench already. Looking forward to this one out living the old bike, and being perfectly broken in on the next one. If you have never owned one of these... The beak in process is a big commitment; but super worth it. Easier than wearing wet jeans until they fit IMHO. That's ridiculous. Buy the official Proofhide conditioner, or a good product intended for baseball gloves. Nokona is what I use. Rub it in. Ride it. Add a little more occasionally. Sweating is okay if you keep it conditioned. But don't get leather wet. Rain covers exist. Get one if you commute. That's what ultimately killed my ~7 year old saddle. Don't get them wet. Don't feed them after midnight!",5
"As a young woman, I was an avide bike rider. This was before mountain bikes, century rides, charity ride, and I did this all on a 10 speed road bike..  Fast forward 30 years.  Life prevented me from ridding like I used to.  I was gifted with a bike a few weeks ago after telling numerous people of my plans to support my daughter on her 100 mile run by riiding along the route.  I have never been in such pain in my life with that factory seat.  Not 1 mile passed without my wanting to get off and give up.  Butts are not supposed to hurt like that, so I knew it was the seat.  An acquaintance asked what saddle I used before, and I remembered it was a Brooks leather saddle.  Well he convinced me that is what I needed. While reviews I have read indicated there is 1000 mile break-in period, for me it has been instant relief. My first ride was 4 miles of pure comfort, and each subsequent one has gotten longer and are equally comfortable.  I would recommend this saddle to anyone who plans on logging lots of miles.  Don't let the fact that it is hard  as rock out of the box fool you, it really is a superb seat!",5
"I first bought a Team Pro Imperial  (Honey Brown)  a couple of months ago to replace another saddle I had been using on my Cannondale R1000 road bike.  It felt great from the first time I rode using it.  I treated it per the instructions before installing it on my bike.  With some bar tape to match it has a great vintage look and is very comfortable.  My second ride with it was a mountainous metric century and I finished it with absolutely no discomfort from the saddle! I have been rebuilding an old touring bike and needed a saddle for it.  Since the Team Pro worked so well I decided to order another Brooks saddle.  My only fault (sort of) with the Team Pro is that there are no eyelets nor other good way to tie a tool bag to the seat.  So,  I ordered a B17 Imperial in standard width and brown color.  Dimensions are very similar to the Team Pro but the frame has eyelets for my toolbag.  One of the first things that I noticed is that the leather on the B17 is noticeably thinner than the leather on the Team Pro.  That makes the seat a bit more flexible and I guess it will be ""broken in"" a bit quicker than the other saddle.  As with the first saddle,  it was comfortable from the first time I sat on it.  That makes the break in time a non-issue for me. I am very pleased with both of my Brooks saddles.  They are a bit more comfortable for me than the ""men's anatomic saddles"" that I had been using previously.  There have been no perineal issues for me which can make a huge difference in whether a saddle works for  long hours on the bike or not.  I would not hesitate to buy another one in the future.",5
"I have ridden somewhere north of a half a dozen higher end saddles. Last year the saddle I had purchased really damaged one side of my butt so I decided to finally give this saddle a chance even though I thought I needed one of the fancy aerodynamic racing/endurance saddles.

"it looks amazing in the light.  it affixed and adjusted MUCH easier that the saddle i had with laces, which was a nightmare.  this is a MENS and i was worried it would be too long.  but, on the bike it is installed, i always found myself pushing back as i pedaled and i ran out of real estate on a WOMANs saddle.  this extra inch in the nose allows me to get in the drops with ease and slide to the back just as quickly.  b/c it's new, it is highly slick and very hard.  but i was not uncomfortable once.  i also noticed that having less width than that of the womans saddle meant i could pedal more naturally, pumping legs up and down much easier.  got to work in record time this morning.  i mistakingly used coconut oil on the leather underside to soften and prematurely break it in, like i have done to other leather saddles without issue.  but it caused the bright red to darken in spots, so am disappointed by that.  still, a refreshing albeit heavy change to the bike commute.  looks so great, i hardly noticed the extra effort needed to hoist the bike up stairs.  this saddle is heavier than the old womans saddle attached to the Thomson seat post!!  haha.  Brooks needs to get titanium under these finely crafted, and near perfect saddles.",4
"The B17 Special is just as comfortable to me as my old saddle, a Team Pro Imperial.  I wanted copper rivets but Brooks does not currently  make an Imperial cut saddle with copper rivets. The B17 Special on right is flatter on top, flares out to the sides more, and sits a little higher than the Team Pro Imperial on left. The leather is initially very dry and will soak up the first application of Proofide.  Compare the darker treated area to the lighter dry area.  It is easier to apply the first treatment of Proofide before you put the saddle on your bicycle. The frame is copper plated except the nose piece.",5
"I was hesitant to pull the trigger on a $90 bike seat but I'm glad I did.  I found it to be comfortable right out of the box and even more so over time.  I've only got about 50 miles on it but it's without a doubt the best saddle I've ever used.  I came from a Selle Italia seat which I liked a lot but after riding the Brooks and switching back I'm not sure how I put so many miles on the Selle.  It feels very rigid but definitely flexes in the right spots when you're sitting on it. The super smooth finish was also something I didn't realize would be so beneficial, basically zero friction no matter what kind of shorts you're wearing.  Of course, you've got to get the angle right or you'll slide forward/back a lot. I wasn't a fan of the old school look on a modern bike at first but it's really grown on me.  Hopefully this will be the last saddle I'll need...",5
"As a bigger guy ( 5'11"" 230lbs ) I ride about 200 miles per week and am always looking to ride longer. I have tried a fair amount of saddles including the super fancy selle italia flite gel flow max which was OK for about a year. After about 3000 miles, it started to hurt more and more despite my weight dropping and extensive seat time. I have always heard these saddles were the most comfortable so I took the risk and IT WAS THE GREATEST CHOICE OF MY LIFE! From the first moment, there was a huge comfort increase. It felt like I was sitting on the sofa. On the first day, I rode it for 30 miles with no padded shorts to help break it in (Which was super comfortable) then the next day I rode 102 miles with padded shorts. The century was the most comfortable I have ever been on a bike and it is getting better. I wish I had bought this in the very beginning instead of looking for the sleek saddles that hurt. I have already gotten multiple compliments on its cools looks and find myself answering other people's questions on how comfortable it is.",5
"As the bike shop kid said, ""You'll swear at it the first 100 miles, and swear by it every mile after that."" Is it hard?  Yes...at first. Is it 'made' for everybody?  Like anything that has a 'fit,' probably not. I don't keep track of miles, but I've had this for about 8 months [riding 40 minutes each way to work, 5 - 6 days a week] and it began feeling comfortable after about a month and a half.  At first, I had sharp nerve pain on one side, but once the seat position was adjusted that pain went away and never returned. I'm 5'4""-ish [female], average weight and the men's B17 works for me.  I'm more slim-hipped than most women, so it probably wouldn't be for every female.  For me, it's well worth every penny.  I had been using cushy seat covers for years--cheaper in the short term, but they slip and slide plus the gel gets wonky after a few months.  Why not put that time on the bike in custom forming a great leather saddle that [over time] molds to *your* individual bum?",5
"I scored this just as my old Brooks Imperial began to tear. A warehouse deal in a ""damaged package"" meant that it had been opened, and the tension wrench was gone. Oh well. Best saddle for a bike at about the wholesale price? Cha-ching! Not my first Brooks, so I have the wrench already. Looking forward to this one out living the old bike, and being perfectly broken in on the next one. If you have never owned one of these... The beak in process is a big commitment; but super worth it. Easier than wearing wet jeans until they fit IMHO. That's ridiculous. Buy the official Proofhide conditioner, or a good product intended for baseball gloves. Nokona is what I use. Rub it in. Ride it. Add a little more occasionally. Sweating is okay if you keep it conditioned. But don't get leather wet. Rain covers exist. Get one if you commute. That's what ultimately killed my ~7 year old saddle. Don't get them wet. Don't feed them after midnight!",5
"As a young woman, I was an avide bike rider. This was before mountain bikes, century rides, charity ride, and I did this all on a 10 speed road bike..  Fast forward 30 years.  Life prevented me from ridding like I used to.  I was gifted with a bike a few weeks ago after telling numerous people of my plans to support my daughter on her 100 mile run by riiding along the route.  I have never been in such pain in my life with that factory seat.  Not 1 mile passed without my wanting to get off and give up.  Butts are not supposed to hurt like that, so I knew it was the seat.  An acquaintance asked what saddle I used before, and I remembered it was a Brooks leather saddle.  Well he convinced me that is what I needed. While reviews I have read indicated there is 1000 mile break-in period, for me it has been instant relief. My first ride was 4 miles of pure comfort, and each subsequent one has gotten longer and are equally comfortable.  I would recommend this saddle to anyone who plans on logging lots of miles.  Don't let the fact that it is hard  as rock out of the box fool you, it really is a superb seat!",5
"I first bought a Team Pro Imperial  (Honey Brown)  a couple of months ago to replace another saddle I had been using on my Cannondale R1000 road bike.  It felt great from the first time I rode using it.  I treated it per the instructions before installing it on my bike.  With some bar tape to match it has a great vintage look and is very comfortable.  My second ride with it was a mountainous metric century and I finished it with absolutely no discomfort from the saddle! I have been rebuilding an old touring bike and needed a saddle for it.  Since the Team Pro worked so well I decided to order another Brooks saddle.  My only fault (sort of) with the Team Pro is that there are no eyelets nor other good way to tie a tool bag to the seat.  So,  I ordered a B17 Imperial in standard width and brown color.  Dimensions are very similar to the Team Pro but the frame has eyelets for my toolbag.  One of the first things that I noticed is that the leather on the B17 is noticeably thinner than the leather on the Team Pro.  That makes the seat a bit more flexible and I guess it will be ""broken in"" a bit quicker than the other saddle.  As with the first saddle,  it was comfortable from the first time I sat on it.  That makes the break in time a non-issue for me. I am very pleased with both of my Brooks saddles.  They are a bit more comfortable for me than the ""men's anatomic saddles"" that I had been using previously.  There have been no perineal issues for me which can make a huge difference in whether a saddle works for  long hours on the bike or not.  I would not hesitate to buy another one in the future.",5
"I have ridden somewhere north of a half a dozen higher end saddles. Last year the saddle I had purchased really damaged one side of my butt so I decided to finally give this saddle a chance even though I thought I needed one of the fancy aerodynamic racing/endurance saddles. Well, I have to say that this saddle is so much better than any other saddle that I have ridden that I am completely in shock. Not only did the right side of my bum feel much better while on the Brooks saddle but it has actually healed up since I've gotten it. If you want a saddle that is going to treat you right then this is the one, bums down!",5
"I was a bit hesitant at first to buy this saddle. Upon my unboxing, it seemed a but hard. And I even had half the mond to return it. But this has by far been the best addition to my roadbike. I ride it to and from school nearly daily after having bought this but plan on making my roadbike as my main means of transport. What a differemce this B17 Standard saddle has made on my ride. Wow wow wow!!! They say ""only mileage can break this saddle in"" and this is true. But let me tell you I am a 5'2"" female weighing in about 125 measley pounds and it only took 4 rides (roughly 50 miles) before it started feeling cushy!!!!

"I was hesitant to pull the trigger on a $90 bike seat but I'm glad I did.  I found it to be comfortable right out of the box and even more so over time.  I've only got about 50 miles on it but it's without a doubt the best saddle I've ever used.  I came from a Selle Italia seat which I liked a lot but after riding the Brooks and switching back I'm not sure how I put so many miles on the Selle.  It feels very rigid but definitely flexes in the right spots when you're sitting on it. The super smooth finish was also something I didn't realize would be so beneficial, basically zero friction no matter what kind of shorts you're wearing.  Of course, you've got to get the angle right or you'll slide forward/back a lot. I wasn't a fan of the old school look on a modern bike at first but it's really grown on me.  Hopefully this will be the last saddle I'll need...",5
"As a bigger guy ( 5'11"" 230lbs ) I ride about 200 miles per week and am always looking to ride longer. I have tried a fair amount of saddles including the super fancy selle italia flite gel flow max which was OK for about a year. After about 3000 miles, it started to hurt more and more despite my weight dropping and extensive seat time. I have always heard these saddles were the most comfortable so I took the risk and IT WAS THE GREATEST CHOICE OF MY LIFE! From the first moment, there was a huge comfort increase. It felt like I was sitting on the sofa. On the first day, I rode it for 30 miles with no padded shorts to help break it in (Which was super comfortable) then the next day I rode 102 miles with padded shorts. The century was the most comfortable I have ever been on a bike and it is getting better. I wish I had bought this in the very beginning instead of looking for the sleek saddles that hurt. I have already gotten multiple compliments on its cools looks and find myself answering other people's questions on how comfortable it is.",5
"As the bike shop kid said, ""You'll swear at it the first 100 miles, and swear by it every mile after that."" Is it hard?  Yes...at first. Is it 'made' for everybody?  Like anything that has a 'fit,' probably not. I don't keep track of miles, but I've had this for about 8 months [riding 40 minutes each way to work, 5 - 6 days a week] and it began feeling comfortable after about a month and a half.  At first, I had sharp nerve pain on one side, but once the seat position was adjusted that pain went away and never returned. I'm 5'4""-ish [female], average weight and the men's B17 works for me.  I'm more slim-hipped than most women, so it probably wouldn't be for every female.  For me, it's well worth every penny.  I had been using cushy seat covers for years--cheaper in the short term, but they slip and slide plus the gel gets wonky after a few months.  Why not put that time on the bike in custom forming a great leather saddle that [over time] molds to *your* individual bum?",5
"I scored this just as my old Brooks Imperial began to tear. A warehouse deal in a ""damaged package"" meant that it had been opened, and the tension wrench was gone. Oh well. Best saddle for a bike at about the wholesale price? Cha-ching! Not my first Brooks, so I have the wrench already. Looking forward to this one out living the old bike, and being perfectly broken in on the next one. If you have never owned one of these... The beak in process is a big commitment; but super worth it. Easier than wearing wet jeans until they fit IMHO. That's ridiculous. Buy the official Proofhide conditioner, or a good product intended for baseball gloves. Nokona is what I use. Rub it in. Ride it. Add a little more occasionally. Sweating is okay if you keep it conditioned. But don't get leather wet. Rain covers exist. Get one if you commute. That's what ultimately killed my ~7 year old saddle. Don't get them wet. Don't feed them after midnight!",5
"As a young woman, I was an avide bike rider. This was before mountain bikes, century rides, charity ride, and I did this all on a 10 speed road bike..  Fast forward 30 years.  Life prevented me from ridding like I used to.  I was gifted with a bike a few weeks ago after telling numerous people of my plans to support my daughter on her 100 mile run by riiding along the route.  I have never been in such pain in my life with that factory seat.  Not 1 mile passed without my wanting to get off and give up.  Butts are not supposed to hurt like that, so I knew it was the seat.  An acquaintance asked what saddle I used before, and I remembered it was a Brooks leather saddle.  Well he convinced me that is what I needed. While reviews I have read indicated there is 1000 mile break-in period, for me it has been instant relief. My first ride was 4 miles of pure comfort, and each subsequent one has gotten longer and are equally comfortable.  I would recommend this saddle to anyone who plans on logging lots of miles.  Don't let the fact that it is hard  as rock out of the box fool you, it really is a superb seat!",5
"I first bought a Team Pro Imperial  (Honey Brown)  a couple of months ago to replace another saddle I had been using on my Cannondale R1000 road bike.  It felt great from the first time I rode using it.  I treated it per the instructions before installing it on my bike.  With some bar tape to match it has a great vintage look and is very comfortable.  My second ride with it was a mountainous metric century and I finished it with absolutely no discomfort from the saddle! I have been rebuilding an old touring bike and needed a saddle for it.  Since the Team Pro worked so well I decided to order another Brooks saddle.  My only fault (sort of) with the Team Pro is that there are no eyelets nor other good way to tie a tool bag to the seat.  So,  I ordered a B17 Imperial in standard width and brown color.  Dimensions are very similar to the Team Pro but the frame has eyelets for my toolbag.  One of the first things that I noticed is that the leather on the B17 is noticeably thinner than the leather on the Team Pro.  That makes the seat a bit more flexible and I guess it will be ""broken in"" a bit quicker than the other saddle.  As with the first saddle,  it was comfortable from the first time I sat on it.  That makes the break in time a non-issue for me. I am very pleased with both of my Brooks saddles.  They are a bit more comfortable for me than the ""men's anatomic saddles"" that I had been using previously.  There have been no perineal issues for me which can make a huge difference in whether a saddle works for  long hours on the bike or not.  I would not hesitate to buy another one in the future.",5
"I have ridden somewhere north of a half a dozen higher end saddles. Last year the saddle I had purchased really damaged one side of my butt so I decided to finally give this saddle a chance even though I thought I needed one of the fancy aerodynamic racing/endurance saddles. Well, I have to say that this saddle is so much better than any other saddle that I have ridden that I am completely in shock. Not only did the right side of my bum feel much better while on the Brooks saddle but it has actually healed up since I've gotten it. If you want a saddle that is going to treat you right then this is the one, bums down!",5
"I was a bit hesitant at first to buy this saddle. Upon my unboxing, it seemed a but hard. And I even had half the mond to return it. But this has by far been the best addition to my roadbike. I ride it to and from school nearly daily after having bought this but plan on making my roadbike as my main means of transport. What a differemce this B17 Standard saddle has made on my ride. Wow wow wow!!! They say ""only mileage can break this saddle in"" and this is true. But let me tell you I am a 5'2"" female weighing in about 125 measley pounds and it only took 4 rides (roughly 50 miles) before it started feeling cushy!!!! Granted I ride my bike with a backpack stuffed with my laptop and chemistry text book. But it feels amazing after having broken it in! I now prefer my bike to be my choice of transport. I use my car only when I had decided to sleep in a little bit longer. But I cannot stress what a difference this little saddle has made! You won't regret it.",5
"it looks amazing in the light.  it affixed and adjusted MUCH easier that the saddle i had with laces, which was a nightmare.  this is a MENS and i was worried it would be too long.  but, on the bike it is installed, i always found myself pushing back as i pedaled and i ran out of real estate on a WOMANs saddle.  this extra inch in the nose allows me to get in the drops with ease and slide to the back just as quickly.  b/c it's new, it is highly slick and very hard.  but i was not uncomfortable once.  i also noticed that having less width than that of the womans saddle meant i could pedal more naturally, pumping legs up and down much easier.  got to work in record time this morning.  i mistakingly used coconut oil on the leather underside to soften and prematurely break it in, like i have done to other leather saddles without issue.  but it caused the bright red to darken in spots, so am disappointed by that.  still, a refreshing albeit heavy change to the bike commute.  looks so great, i hardly noticed the extra effort needed to hoist the bike up stairs.  this saddle is heavier than the old womans saddle attached to the Thomson seat post!!  haha.  Brooks needs to get titanium under these finely crafted, and near perfect saddles.",4
"The B17 Special is just as comfortable to me as my old saddle, a Team Pro Imperial.  I wanted copper rivets but Brooks does not currently  make an Imperial cut saddle with copper rivets. The B17 Special on right is flatter on top, flares out to the sides more, and sits a little higher than the Team Pro Imperial on left.

I have already gotten multiple compliments on its cools looks and find myself answering other people's questions on how comfortable it is.",5
"As the bike shop kid said, ""You'll swear at it the first 100 miles, and swear by it every mile after that."" Is it hard?  Yes...at first. Is it 'made' for everybody?  Like anything that has a 'fit,' probably not. I don't keep track of miles, but I've had this for about 8 months [riding 40 minutes each way to work, 5 - 6 days a week] and it began feeling comfortable after about a month and a half.  At first, I had sharp nerve pain on one side, but once the seat position was adjusted that pain went away and never returned. I'm 5'4""-ish [female], average weight and the men's B17 works for me.  I'm more slim-hipped than most women, so it probably wouldn't be for every female.  For me, it's well worth every penny.  I had been using cushy seat covers for years--cheaper in the short term, but they slip and slide plus the gel gets wonky after a few months.  Why not put that time on the bike in custom forming a great leather saddle that [over time] molds to *your* individual bum?",5
"I scored this just as my old Brooks Imperial began to tear. A warehouse deal in a ""damaged package"" meant that it had been opened, and the tension wrench was gone. Oh well. Best saddle for a bike at about the wholesale price? Cha-ching! Not my first Brooks, so I have the wrench already. Looking forward to this one out living the old bike, and being perfectly broken in on the next one. If you have never owned one of these... The beak in process is a big commitment; but super worth it. Easier than wearing wet jeans until they fit IMHO. That's ridiculous. Buy the official Proofhide conditioner, or a good product intended for baseball gloves. Nokona is what I use. Rub it in. Ride it. Add a little more occasionally. Sweating is okay if you keep it conditioned. But don't get leather wet. Rain covers exist. Get one if you commute. That's what ultimately killed my ~7 year old saddle. Don't get them wet. Don't feed them after midnight!",5
"As a young woman, I was an avide bike rider. This was before mountain bikes, century rides, charity ride, and I did this all on a 10 speed road bike..  Fast forward 30 years.  Life prevented me from ridding like I used to.  I was gifted with a bike a few weeks ago after telling numerous people of my plans to support my daughter on her 100 mile run by riiding along the route.  I have never been in such pain in my life with that factory seat.  Not 1 mile passed without my wanting to get off and give up.  Butts are not supposed to hurt like that, so I knew it was the seat.  An acquaintance asked what saddle I used before, and I remembered it was a Brooks leather saddle.  Well he convinced me that is what I needed. While reviews I have read indicated there is 1000 mile break-in period, for me it has been instant relief. My first ride was 4 miles of pure comfort, and each subsequent one has gotten longer and are equally comfortable.  I would recommend this saddle to anyone who plans on logging lots of miles.  Don't let the fact that it is hard  as rock out of the box fool you, it really is a superb seat!",5
"I first bought a Team Pro Imperial  (Honey Brown)  a couple of months ago to replace another saddle I had been using on my Cannondale R1000 road bike.  It felt great from the first time I rode using it.  I treated it per the instructions before installing it on my bike.  With some bar tape to match it has a great vintage look and is very comfortable.  My second ride with it was a mountainous metric century and I finished it with absolutely no discomfort from the saddle! I have been rebuilding an old touring bike and needed a saddle for it.  Since the Team Pro worked so well I decided to order another Brooks saddle.  My only fault (sort of) with the Team Pro is that there are no eyelets nor other good way to tie a tool bag to the seat.  So,  I ordered a B17 Imperial in standard width and brown color.  Dimensions are very similar to the Team Pro but the frame has eyelets for my toolbag.  One of the first things that I noticed is that the leather on the B17 is noticeably thinner than the leather on the Team Pro.  That makes the seat a bit more flexible and I guess it will be ""broken in"" a bit quicker than the other saddle.  As with the first saddle,  it was comfortable from the first time I sat on it.  That makes the break in time a non-issue for me. I am very pleased with both of my Brooks saddles.  They are a bit more comfortable for me than the ""men's anatomic saddles"" that I had been using previously.  There have been no perineal issues for me which can make a huge difference in whether a saddle works for  long hours on the bike or not.  I would not hesitate to buy another one in the future.",5
"I have ridden somewhere north of a half a dozen higher end saddles. Last year the saddle I had purchased really damaged one side of my butt so I decided to finally give this saddle a chance even though I thought I needed one of the fancy aerodynamic racing/endurance saddles. Well, I have to say that this saddle is so much better than any other saddle that I have ridden that I am completely in shock. Not only did the right side of my bum feel much better while on the Brooks saddle but it has actually healed up since I've gotten it. If you want a saddle that is going to treat you right then this is the one, bums down!",5
"I was a bit hesitant at first to buy this saddle. Upon my unboxing, it seemed a but hard. And I even had half the mond to return it. But this has by far been the best addition to my roadbike. I ride it to and from school nearly daily after having bought this but plan on making my roadbike as my main means of transport. What a differemce this B17 Standard saddle has made on my ride. Wow wow wow!!! They say ""only mileage can break this saddle in"" and this is true. But let me tell you I am a 5'2"" female weighing in about 125 measley pounds and it only took 4 rides (roughly 50 miles) before it started feeling cushy!!!! Granted I ride my bike with a backpack stuffed with my laptop and chemistry text book. But it feels amazing after having broken it in! I now prefer my bike to be my choice of transport. I use my car only when I had decided to sleep in a little bit longer. But I cannot stress what a difference this little saddle has made! You won't regret it.",5
"it looks amazing in the light.  it affixed and adjusted MUCH easier that the saddle i had with laces, which was a nightmare.  this is a MENS and i was worried it would be too long.  but, on the bike it is installed, i always found myself pushing back as i pedaled and i ran out of real estate on a WOMANs saddle.  this extra inch in the nose allows me to get in the drops with ease and slide to the back just as quickly.  b/c it's new, it is highly slick and very hard.  but i was not uncomfortable once.  i also noticed that having less width than that of the womans saddle meant i could pedal more naturally, pumping legs up and down much easier.  got to work in record time this morning.  i mistakingly used coconut oil on the leather underside to soften and prematurely break it in, like i have done to other leather saddles without issue.  but it caused the bright red to darken in spots, so am disappointed by that.  still, a refreshing albeit heavy change to the bike commute.  looks so great, i hardly noticed the extra effort needed to hoist the bike up stairs.  this saddle is heavier than the old womans saddle attached to the Thomson seat post!!  haha.  Brooks needs to get titanium under these finely crafted, and near perfect saddles.",4
"The B17 Special is just as comfortable to me as my old saddle, a Team Pro Imperial.  I wanted copper rivets but Brooks does not currently  make an Imperial cut saddle with copper rivets. The B17 Special on right is flatter on top, flares out to the sides more, and sits a little higher than the Team Pro Imperial on left. The leather is initially very dry and will soak up the first application of Proofide.  Compare the darker treated area to the lighter dry area.  It is easier to apply the first treatment of Proofide before you put the saddle on your bicycle. The frame is copper plated except the nose piece.",5
"I was hesitant to pull the trigger on a $90 bike seat but I'm glad I did.  I found it to be comfortable right out of the box and even more so over time.  I've only got about 50 miles on it but it's without a doubt the best saddle I've ever used.  I came from a Selle Italia seat which I liked a lot but after riding the Brooks and switching back I'm not sure how I put so many miles on the Selle.  It feels very rigid but definitely flexes in the right spots when you're sitting on it. The super smooth finish was also something I didn't realize would be so beneficial, basically zero friction no matter what kind of shorts you're wearing.  Of course, you've got to get the angle right or you'll slide forward/back a lot. I wasn't a fan of the old school look on a modern bike at first but it's really grown on me.  Hopefully this will be the last saddle I'll need...",5
"As a bigger guy ( 5'11"" 230lbs ) I ride about 200 miles per week and am always looking to ride longer. I have tried a fair amount of saddles including the super fancy selle italia flite gel flow max which was OK for about a year. After about 3000 miles, it started to hurt more and more despite my weight dropping and extensive seat time. I have always heard these saddles were the most comfortable so I took the risk and IT WAS THE GREATEST CHOICE OF MY LIFE! From the first moment, there was a huge comfort increase. It felt like I was sitting on the sofa. On the first day, I rode it for 30 miles with no padded shorts to help break it in (Which was super comfortable) then the next day I rode 102 miles with padded shorts.

Buy the official Proofhide conditioner, or a good product intended for baseball gloves. Nokona is what I use. Rub it in. Ride it. Add a little more occasionally. Sweating is okay if you keep it conditioned. But don't get leather wet. Rain covers exist. Get one if you commute. That's what ultimately killed my ~7 year old saddle. Don't get them wet. Don't feed them after midnight!",5
"As a young woman, I was an avide bike rider. This was before mountain bikes, century rides, charity ride, and I did this all on a 10 speed road bike..  Fast forward 30 years.  Life prevented me from ridding like I used to.  I was gifted with a bike a few weeks ago after telling numerous people of my plans to support my daughter on her 100 mile run by riiding along the route.  I have never been in such pain in my life with that factory seat.  Not 1 mile passed without my wanting to get off and give up.  Butts are not supposed to hurt like that, so I knew it was the seat.  An acquaintance asked what saddle I used before, and I remembered it was a Brooks leather saddle.  Well he convinced me that is what I needed. While reviews I have read indicated there is 1000 mile break-in period, for me it has been instant relief. My first ride was 4 miles of pure comfort, and each subsequent one has gotten longer and are equally comfortable.  I would recommend this saddle to anyone who plans on logging lots of miles.  Don't let the fact that it is hard  as rock out of the box fool you, it really is a superb seat!",5
"I first bought a Team Pro Imperial  (Honey Brown)  a couple of months ago to replace another saddle I had been using on my Cannondale R1000 road bike.  It felt great from the first time I rode using it.  I treated it per the instructions before installing it on my bike.  With some bar tape to match it has a great vintage look and is very comfortable.  My second ride with it was a mountainous metric century and I finished it with absolutely no discomfort from the saddle! I have been rebuilding an old touring bike and needed a saddle for it.  Since the Team Pro worked so well I decided to order another Brooks saddle.  My only fault (sort of) with the Team Pro is that there are no eyelets nor other good way to tie a tool bag to the seat.  So,  I ordered a B17 Imperial in standard width and brown color.  Dimensions are very similar to the Team Pro but the frame has eyelets for my toolbag.  One of the first things that I noticed is that the leather on the B17 is noticeably thinner than the leather on the Team Pro.  That makes the seat a bit more flexible and I guess it will be ""broken in"" a bit quicker than the other saddle.  As with the first saddle,  it was comfortable from the first time I sat on it.  That makes the break in time a non-issue for me. I am very pleased with both of my Brooks saddles.  They are a bit more comfortable for me than the ""men's anatomic saddles"" that I had been using previously.  There have been no perineal issues for me which can make a huge difference in whether a saddle works for  long hours on the bike or not.  I would not hesitate to buy another one in the future.",5
"I have ridden somewhere north of a half a dozen higher end saddles. Last year the saddle I had purchased really damaged one side of my butt so I decided to finally give this saddle a chance even though I thought I needed one of the fancy aerodynamic racing/endurance saddles. Well, I have to say that this saddle is so much better than any other saddle that I have ridden that I am completely in shock. Not only did the right side of my bum feel much better while on the Brooks saddle but it has actually healed up since I've gotten it. If you want a saddle that is going to treat you right then this is the one, bums down!",5
"I was a bit hesitant at first to buy this saddle. Upon my unboxing, it seemed a but hard. And I even had half the mond to return it. But this has by far been the best addition to my roadbike. I ride it to and from school nearly daily after having bought this but plan on making my roadbike as my main means of transport. What a differemce this B17 Standard saddle has made on my ride. Wow wow wow!!! They say ""only mileage can break this saddle in"" and this is true. But let me tell you I am a 5'2"" female weighing in about 125 measley pounds and it only took 4 rides (roughly 50 miles) before it started feeling cushy!!!! Granted I ride my bike with a backpack stuffed with my laptop and chemistry text book. But it feels amazing after having broken it in! I now prefer my bike to be my choice of transport. I use my car only when I had decided to sleep in a little bit longer. But I cannot stress what a difference this little saddle has made! You won't regret it.",5
"it looks amazing in the light.  it affixed and adjusted MUCH easier that the saddle i had with laces, which was a nightmare.  this is a MENS and i was worried it would be too long.  but, on the bike it is installed, i always found myself pushing back as i pedaled and i ran out of real estate on a WOMANs saddle.  this extra inch in the nose allows me to get in the drops with ease and slide to the back just as quickly.  b/c it's new, it is highly slick and very hard.  but i was not uncomfortable once.  i also noticed that having less width than that of the womans saddle meant i could pedal more naturally, pumping legs up and down much easier.  got to work in record time this morning.  i mistakingly used coconut oil on the leather underside to soften and prematurely break it in, like i have done to other leather saddles without issue.  but it caused the bright red to darken in spots, so am disappointed by that.  still, a refreshing albeit heavy change to the bike commute.  looks so great, i hardly noticed the extra effort needed to hoist the bike up stairs.  this saddle is heavier than the old womans saddle attached to the Thomson seat post!!  haha.  Brooks needs to get titanium under these finely crafted, and near perfect saddles.",4
"The B17 Special is just as comfortable to me as my old saddle, a Team Pro Imperial.  I wanted copper rivets but Brooks does not currently  make an Imperial cut saddle with copper rivets. The B17 Special on right is flatter on top, flares out to the sides more, and sits a little higher than the Team Pro Imperial on left. The leather is initially very dry and will soak up the first application of Proofide.  Compare the darker treated area to the lighter dry area.  It is easier to apply the first treatment of Proofide before you put the saddle on your bicycle. The frame is copper plated except the nose piece.",5
"I was hesitant to pull the trigger on a $90 bike seat but I'm glad I did.  I found it to be comfortable right out of the box and even more so over time.  I've only got about 50 miles on it but it's without a doubt the best saddle I've ever used.  I came from a Selle Italia seat which I liked a lot but after riding the Brooks and switching back I'm not sure how I put so many miles on the Selle.  It feels very rigid but definitely flexes in the right spots when you're sitting on it. The super smooth finish was also something I didn't realize would be so beneficial, basically zero friction no matter what kind of shorts you're wearing.  Of course, you've got to get the angle right or you'll slide forward/back a lot. I wasn't a fan of the old school look on a modern bike at first but it's really grown on me.  Hopefully this will be the last saddle I'll need...",5
"As a bigger guy ( 5'11"" 230lbs ) I ride about 200 miles per week and am always looking to ride longer. I have tried a fair amount of saddles including the super fancy selle italia flite gel flow max which was OK for about a year. After about 3000 miles, it started to hurt more and more despite my weight dropping and extensive seat time. I have always heard these saddles were the most comfortable so I took the risk and IT WAS THE GREATEST CHOICE OF MY LIFE! From the first moment, there was a huge comfort increase. It felt like I was sitting on the sofa. On the first day, I rode it for 30 miles with no padded shorts to help break it in (Which was super comfortable) then the next day I rode 102 miles with padded shorts. The century was the most comfortable I have ever been on a bike and it is getting better. I wish I had bought this in the very beginning instead of looking for the sleek saddles that hurt. I have already gotten multiple compliments on its cools looks and find myself answering other people's questions on how comfortable it is.",5
"As the bike shop kid said, ""You'll swear at it the first 100 miles, and swear by it every mile after that."" Is it hard?  Yes...at first. Is it 'made' for everybody?  Like anything that has a 'fit,' probably not. I don't keep track of miles, but I've had this for about 8 months [riding 40 minutes each way to work, 5 - 6 days a week] and it began feeling comfortable after about a month and a half.  At first, I had sharp nerve pain on one side, but once the seat position was adjusted that pain went away and never returned. I'm 5'4""-ish [female], average weight and the men's B17 works for me.  I'm more slim-hipped than most women, so it probably wouldn't be for every female.  For me, it's well worth every penny.  I had been using cushy seat covers for years--cheaper in the short term, but they slip and slide plus the gel gets wonky after a few months.  Why not put that time on the bike in custom forming a great leather saddle that [over time] molds to *your* individual bum?",5
"I scored this just as my old Brooks Imperial began to tear. A warehouse deal in a ""damaged package"" meant that it had been opened, and the tension wrench was gone. Oh well. Best saddle for a bike at about the wholesale price? Cha-ching! Not my first Brooks, so I have the wrench already.

My second ride with it was a mountainous metric century and I finished it with absolutely no discomfort from the saddle! I have been rebuilding an old touring bike and needed a saddle for it.  Since the Team Pro worked so well I decided to order another Brooks saddle.  My only fault (sort of) with the Team Pro is that there are no eyelets nor other good way to tie a tool bag to the seat.  So,  I ordered a B17 Imperial in standard width and brown color.  Dimensions are very similar to the Team Pro but the frame has eyelets for my toolbag.  One of the first things that I noticed is that the leather on the B17 is noticeably thinner than the leather on the Team Pro.  That makes the seat a bit more flexible and I guess it will be ""broken in"" a bit quicker than the other saddle.  As with the first saddle,  it was comfortable from the first time I sat on it.  That makes the break in time a non-issue for me. I am very pleased with both of my Brooks saddles.  They are a bit more comfortable for me than the ""men's anatomic saddles"" that I had been using previously.  There have been no perineal issues for me which can make a huge difference in whether a saddle works for  long hours on the bike or not.  I would not hesitate to buy another one in the future.",5
"I have ridden somewhere north of a half a dozen higher end saddles. Last year the saddle I had purchased really damaged one side of my butt so I decided to finally give this saddle a chance even though I thought I needed one of the fancy aerodynamic racing/endurance saddles. Well, I have to say that this saddle is so much better than any other saddle that I have ridden that I am completely in shock. Not only did the right side of my bum feel much better while on the Brooks saddle but it has actually healed up since I've gotten it. If you want a saddle that is going to treat you right then this is the one, bums down!",5
"I was a bit hesitant at first to buy this saddle. Upon my unboxing, it seemed a but hard. And I even had half the mond to return it. But this has by far been the best addition to my roadbike. I ride it to and from school nearly daily after having bought this but plan on making my roadbike as my main means of transport. What a differemce this B17 Standard saddle has made on my ride. Wow wow wow!!! They say ""only mileage can break this saddle in"" and this is true. But let me tell you I am a 5'2"" female weighing in about 125 measley pounds and it only took 4 rides (roughly 50 miles) before it started feeling cushy!!!! Granted I ride my bike with a backpack stuffed with my laptop and chemistry text book. But it feels amazing after having broken it in! I now prefer my bike to be my choice of transport. I use my car only when I had decided to sleep in a little bit longer. But I cannot stress what a difference this little saddle has made! You won't regret it.",5
"it looks amazing in the light.  it affixed and adjusted MUCH easier that the saddle i had with laces, which was a nightmare.  this is a MENS and i was worried it would be too long.  but, on the bike it is installed, i always found myself pushing back as i pedaled and i ran out of real estate on a WOMANs saddle.  this extra inch in the nose allows me to get in the drops with ease and slide to the back just as quickly.  b/c it's new, it is highly slick and very hard.  but i was not uncomfortable once.  i also noticed that having less width than that of the womans saddle meant i could pedal more naturally, pumping legs up and down much easier.  got to work in record time this morning.  i mistakingly used coconut oil on the leather underside to soften and prematurely break it in, like i have done to other leather saddles without issue.  but it caused the bright red to darken in spots, so am disappointed by that.  still, a refreshing albeit heavy change to the bike commute.  looks so great, i hardly noticed the extra effort needed to hoist the bike up stairs.  this saddle is heavier than the old womans saddle attached to the Thomson seat post!!  haha.  Brooks needs to get titanium under these finely crafted, and near perfect saddles.",4
"The B17 Special is just as comfortable to me as my old saddle, a Team Pro Imperial.  I wanted copper rivets but Brooks does not currently  make an Imperial cut saddle with copper rivets. The B17 Special on right is flatter on top, flares out to the sides more, and sits a little higher than the Team Pro Imperial on left. The leather is initially very dry and will soak up the first application of Proofide.  Compare the darker treated area to the lighter dry area.  It is easier to apply the first treatment of Proofide before you put the saddle on your bicycle. The frame is copper plated except the nose piece.",5
"I was hesitant to pull the trigger on a $90 bike seat but I'm glad I did.  I found it to be comfortable right out of the box and even more so over time.  I've only got about 50 miles on it but it's without a doubt the best saddle I've ever used.  I came from a Selle Italia seat which I liked a lot but after riding the Brooks and switching back I'm not sure how I put so many miles on the Selle.  It feels very rigid but definitely flexes in the right spots when you're sitting on it. The super smooth finish was also something I didn't realize would be so beneficial, basically zero friction no matter what kind of shorts you're wearing.  Of course, you've got to get the angle right or you'll slide forward/back a lot. I wasn't a fan of the old school look on a modern bike at first but it's really grown on me.  Hopefully this will be the last saddle I'll need...",5
"As a bigger guy ( 5'11"" 230lbs ) I ride about 200 miles per week and am always looking to ride longer. I have tried a fair amount of saddles including the super fancy selle italia flite gel flow max which was OK for about a year. After about 3000 miles, it started to hurt more and more despite my weight dropping and extensive seat time. I have always heard these saddles were the most comfortable so I took the risk and IT WAS THE GREATEST CHOICE OF MY LIFE! From the first moment, there was a huge comfort increase. It felt like I was sitting on the sofa. On the first day, I rode it for 30 miles with no padded shorts to help break it in (Which was super comfortable) then the next day I rode 102 miles with padded shorts. The century was the most comfortable I have ever been on a bike and it is getting better. I wish I had bought this in the very beginning instead of looking for the sleek saddles that hurt. I have already gotten multiple compliments on its cools looks and find myself answering other people's questions on how comfortable it is.",5
"As the bike shop kid said, ""You'll swear at it the first 100 miles, and swear by it every mile after that."" Is it hard?  Yes...at first. Is it 'made' for everybody?  Like anything that has a 'fit,' probably not. I don't keep track of miles, but I've had this for about 8 months [riding 40 minutes each way to work, 5 - 6 days a week] and it began feeling comfortable after about a month and a half.  At first, I had sharp nerve pain on one side, but once the seat position was adjusted that pain went away and never returned. I'm 5'4""-ish [female], average weight and the men's B17 works for me.  I'm more slim-hipped than most women, so it probably wouldn't be for every female.  For me, it's well worth every penny.  I had been using cushy seat covers for years--cheaper in the short term, but they slip and slide plus the gel gets wonky after a few months.  Why not put that time on the bike in custom forming a great leather saddle that [over time] molds to *your* individual bum?",5
"I scored this just as my old Brooks Imperial began to tear. A warehouse deal in a ""damaged package"" meant that it had been opened, and the tension wrench was gone. Oh well. Best saddle for a bike at about the wholesale price? Cha-ching! Not my first Brooks, so I have the wrench already. Looking forward to this one out living the old bike, and being perfectly broken in on the next one. If you have never owned one of these... The beak in process is a big commitment; but super worth it. Easier than wearing wet jeans until they fit IMHO. That's ridiculous. Buy the official Proofhide conditioner, or a good product intended for baseball gloves. Nokona is what I use. Rub it in. Ride it. Add a little more occasionally. Sweating is okay if you keep it conditioned. But don't get leather wet. Rain covers exist. Get one if you commute. That's what ultimately killed my ~7 year old saddle. Don't get them wet. Don't feed them after midnight!",5
"As a young woman, I was an avide bike rider. This was before mountain bikes, century rides, charity ride, and I did this all on a 10 speed road bike..  Fast forward 30 years.  Life prevented me from ridding like I used to.  I was gifted with a bike a few weeks ago after telling numerous people of my plans to support my daughter on her 100 mile run by riiding along the route.  I have never been in such pain in my life with that factory seat.  Not 1 mile passed without my wanting to get off and give up.  Butts are not supposed to hurt like that, so I knew it was the seat.  An acquaintance asked what saddle I used before, and I remembered it was a Brooks leather saddle.  Well he convinced me that is what I needed. While reviews I have read indicated there is 1000 mile break-in period, for me it has been instant relief. My first ride was 4 miles of pure comfort, and each subsequent one has gotten longer and are equally comfortable.  I would recommend this saddle to anyone who plans on logging lots of miles.  Don't let the fact that it is hard  as rock out of the box fool you, it really is a superb seat!",5

"I was a bit hesitant at first to buy this saddle. Upon my unboxing, it seemed a but hard. And I even had half the mond to return it. But this has by far been the best addition to my roadbike. I ride it to and from school nearly daily after having bought this but plan on making my roadbike as my main means of transport. What a differemce this B17 Standard saddle has made on my ride. Wow wow wow!!! They say ""only mileage can break this saddle in"" and this is true. But let me tell you I am a 5'2"" female weighing in about 125 measley pounds and it only took 4 rides (roughly 50 miles) before it started feeling cushy!!!! Granted I ride my bike with a backpack stuffed with my laptop and chemistry text book. But it feels amazing after having broken it in! I now prefer my bike to be my choice of transport. I use my car only when I had decided to sleep in a little bit longer. But I cannot stress what a difference this little saddle has made! You won't regret it.",5
"it looks amazing in the light.  it affixed and adjusted MUCH easier that the saddle i had with laces, which was a nightmare.  this is a MENS and i was worried it would be too long.  but, on the bike it is installed, i always found myself pushing back as i pedaled and i ran out of real estate on a WOMANs saddle.  this extra inch in the nose allows me to get in the drops with ease and slide to the back just as quickly.  b/c it's new, it is highly slick and very hard.  but i was not uncomfortable once.  i also noticed that having less width than that of the womans saddle meant i could pedal more naturally, pumping legs up and down much easier.  got to work in record time this morning.  i mistakingly used coconut oil on the leather underside to soften and prematurely break it in, like i have done to other leather saddles without issue.  but it caused the bright red to darken in spots, so am disappointed by that.  still, a refreshing albeit heavy change to the bike commute.  looks so great, i hardly noticed the extra effort needed to hoist the bike up stairs.  this saddle is heavier than the old womans saddle attached to the Thomson seat post!!  haha.  Brooks needs to get titanium under these finely crafted, and near perfect saddles.",4
"The B17 Special is just as comfortable to me as my old saddle, a Team Pro Imperial.  I wanted copper rivets but Brooks does not currently  make an Imperial cut saddle with copper rivets. The B17 Special on right is flatter on top, flares out to the sides more, and sits a little higher than the Team Pro Imperial on left. The leather is initially very dry and will soak up the first application of Proofide.  Compare the darker treated area to the lighter dry area.  It is easier to apply the first treatment of Proofide before you put the saddle on your bicycle. The frame is copper plated except the nose piece.",5
"I was hesitant to pull the trigger on a $90 bike seat but I'm glad I did.  I found it to be comfortable right out of the box and even more so over time.  I've only got about 50 miles on it but it's without a doubt the best saddle I've ever used.  I came from a Selle Italia seat which I liked a lot but after riding the Brooks and switching back I'm not sure how I put so many miles on the Selle.  It feels very rigid but definitely flexes in the right spots when you're sitting on it. The super smooth finish was also something I didn't realize would be so beneficial, basically zero friction no matter what kind of shorts you're wearing.  Of course, you've got to get the angle right or you'll slide forward/back a lot. I wasn't a fan of the old school look on a modern bike at first but it's really grown on me.  Hopefully this will be the last saddle I'll need...",5
"As a bigger guy ( 5'11"" 230lbs ) I ride about 200 miles per week and am always looking to ride longer. I have tried a fair amount of saddles including the super fancy selle italia flite gel flow max which was OK for about a year. After about 3000 miles, it started to hurt more and more despite my weight dropping and extensive seat time. I have always heard these saddles were the most comfortable so I took the risk and IT WAS THE GREATEST CHOICE OF MY LIFE! From the first moment, there was a huge comfort increase. It felt like I was sitting on the sofa. On the first day, I rode it for 30 miles with no padded shorts to help break it in (Which was super comfortable) then the next day I rode 102 miles with padded shorts. The century was the most comfortable I have ever been on a bike and it is getting better. I wish I had bought this in the very beginning instead of looking for the sleek saddles that hurt. I have already gotten multiple compliments on its cools looks and find myself answering other people's questions on how comfortable it is.",5
"As the bike shop kid said, ""You'll swear at it the first 100 miles, and swear by it every mile after that."" Is it hard?  Yes...at first. Is it 'made' for everybody?  Like anything that has a 'fit,' probably not. I don't keep track of miles, but I've had this for about 8 months [riding 40 minutes each way to work, 5 - 6 days a week] and it began feeling comfortable after about a month and a half.  At first, I had sharp nerve pain on one side, but once the seat position was adjusted that pain went away and never returned. I'm 5'4""-ish [female], average weight and the men's B17 works for me.  I'm more slim-hipped than most women, so it probably wouldn't be for every female.  For me, it's well worth every penny.  I had been using cushy seat covers for years--cheaper in the short term, but they slip and slide plus the gel gets wonky after a few months.  Why not put that time on the bike in custom forming a great leather saddle that [over time] molds to *your* individual bum?",5
"I scored this just as my old Brooks Imperial began to tear. A warehouse deal in a ""damaged package"" meant that it had been opened, and the tension wrench was gone. Oh well. Best saddle for a bike at about the wholesale price? Cha-ching! Not my first Brooks, so I have the wrench already. Looking forward to this one out living the old bike, and being perfectly broken in on the next one. If you have never owned one of these... The beak in process is a big commitment; but super worth it. Easier than wearing wet jeans until they fit IMHO. That's ridiculous. Buy the official Proofhide conditioner, or a good product intended for baseball gloves. Nokona is what I use. Rub it in. Ride it. Add a little more occasionally. Sweating is okay if you keep it conditioned. But don't get leather wet. Rain covers exist. Get one if you commute. That's what ultimately killed my ~7 year old saddle. Don't get them wet. Don't feed them after midnight!",5
"As a young woman, I was an avide bike rider. This was before mountain bikes, century rides, charity ride, and I did this all on a 10 speed road bike..  Fast forward 30 years.  Life prevented me from ridding like I used to.  I was gifted with a bike a few weeks ago after telling numerous people of my plans to support my daughter on her 100 mile run by riiding along the route.  I have never been in such pain in my life with that factory seat.  Not 1 mile passed without my wanting to get off and give up.  Butts are not supposed to hurt like that, so I knew it was the seat.  An acquaintance asked what saddle I used before, and I remembered it was a Brooks leather saddle.  Well he convinced me that is what I needed. While reviews I have read indicated there is 1000 mile break-in period, for me it has been instant relief. My first ride was 4 miles of pure comfort, and each subsequent one has gotten longer and are equally comfortable.  I would recommend this saddle to anyone who plans on logging lots of miles.  Don't let the fact that it is hard  as rock out of the box fool you, it really is a superb seat!",5
"I first bought a Team Pro Imperial  (Honey Brown)  a couple of months ago to replace another saddle I had been using on my Cannondale R1000 road bike.  It felt great from the first time I rode using it.  I treated it per the instructions before installing it on my bike.  With some bar tape to match it has a great vintage look and is very comfortable.  My second ride with it was a mountainous metric century and I finished it with absolutely no discomfort from the saddle! I have been rebuilding an old touring bike and needed a saddle for it.  Since the Team Pro worked so well I decided to order another Brooks saddle.  My only fault (sort of) with the Team Pro is that there are no eyelets nor other good way to tie a tool bag to the seat.  So,  I ordered a B17 Imperial in standard width and brown color.  Dimensions are very similar to the Team Pro but the frame has eyelets for my toolbag.  One of the first things that I noticed is that the leather on the B17 is noticeably thinner than the leather on the Team Pro.  That makes the seat a bit more flexible and I guess it will be ""broken in"" a bit quicker than the other saddle.  As with the first saddle,  it was comfortable from the first time I sat on it.  That makes the break in time a non-issue for me. I am very pleased with both of my Brooks saddles.  They are a bit more comfortable for me than the ""men's anatomic saddles"" that I had been using previously.  There have been no perineal issues for me which can make a huge difference in whether a saddle works for  long hours on the bike or not.  I would not hesitate to buy another one in the future.",5
"I have ridden somewhere north of a half a dozen higher end saddles. Last year the saddle I had purchased really damaged one side of my butt so I decided to finally give this saddle a chance even though I thought I needed one of the fancy aerodynamic racing/endurance saddles.

"it looks amazing in the light.  it affixed and adjusted MUCH easier that the saddle i had with laces, which was a nightmare.  this is a MENS and i was worried it would be too long.  but, on the bike it is installed, i always found myself pushing back as i pedaled and i ran out of real estate on a WOMANs saddle.  this extra inch in the nose allows me to get in the drops with ease and slide to the back just as quickly.  b/c it's new, it is highly slick and very hard.  but i was not uncomfortable once.  i also noticed that having less width than that of the womans saddle meant i could pedal more naturally, pumping legs up and down much easier.  got to work in record time this morning.  i mistakingly used coconut oil on the leather underside to soften and prematurely break it in, like i have done to other leather saddles without issue.  but it caused the bright red to darken in spots, so am disappointed by that.  still, a refreshing albeit heavy change to the bike commute.  looks so great, i hardly noticed the extra effort needed to hoist the bike up stairs.  this saddle is heavier than the old womans saddle attached to the Thomson seat post!!  haha.  Brooks needs to get titanium under these finely crafted, and near perfect saddles.",4
"The B17 Special is just as comfortable to me as my old saddle, a Team Pro Imperial.  I wanted copper rivets but Brooks does not currently  make an Imperial cut saddle with copper rivets. The B17 Special on right is flatter on top, flares out to the sides more, and sits a little higher than the Team Pro Imperial on left. The leather is initially very dry and will soak up the first application of Proofide.  Compare the darker treated area to the lighter dry area.  It is easier to apply the first treatment of Proofide before you put the saddle on your bicycle. The frame is copper plated except the nose piece.",5
"I was hesitant to pull the trigger on a $90 bike seat but I'm glad I did.  I found it to be comfortable right out of the box and even more so over time.  I've only got about 50 miles on it but it's without a doubt the best saddle I've ever used.  I came from a Selle Italia seat which I liked a lot but after riding the Brooks and switching back I'm not sure how I put so many miles on the Selle.  It feels very rigid but definitely flexes in the right spots when you're sitting on it. The super smooth finish was also something I didn't realize would be so beneficial, basically zero friction no matter what kind of shorts you're wearing.  Of course, you've got to get the angle right or you'll slide forward/back a lot. I wasn't a fan of the old school look on a modern bike at first but it's really grown on me.  Hopefully this will be the last saddle I'll need...",5
"As a bigger guy ( 5'11"" 230lbs ) I ride about 200 miles per week and am always looking to ride longer. I have tried a fair amount of saddles including the super fancy selle italia flite gel flow max which was OK for about a year. After about 3000 miles, it started to hurt more and more despite my weight dropping and extensive seat time. I have always heard these saddles were the most comfortable so I took the risk and IT WAS THE GREATEST CHOICE OF MY LIFE! From the first moment, there was a huge comfort increase. It felt like I was sitting on the sofa. On the first day, I rode it for 30 miles with no padded shorts to help break it in (Which was super comfortable) then the next day I rode 102 miles with padded shorts. The century was the most comfortable I have ever been on a bike and it is getting better. I wish I had bought this in the very beginning instead of looking for the sleek saddles that hurt. I have already gotten multiple compliments on its cools looks and find myself answering other people's questions on how comfortable it is.",5
"As the bike shop kid said, ""You'll swear at it the first 100 miles, and swear by it every mile after that."" Is it hard?  Yes...at first. Is it 'made' for everybody?  Like anything that has a 'fit,' probably not. I don't keep track of miles, but I've had this for about 8 months [riding 40 minutes each way to work, 5 - 6 days a week] and it began feeling comfortable after about a month and a half.  At first, I had sharp nerve pain on one side, but once the seat position was adjusted that pain went away and never returned. I'm 5'4""-ish [female], average weight and the men's B17 works for me.  I'm more slim-hipped than most women, so it probably wouldn't be for every female.  For me, it's well worth every penny.  I had been using cushy seat covers for years--cheaper in the short term, but they slip and slide plus the gel gets wonky after a few months.  Why not put that time on the bike in custom forming a great leather saddle that [over time] molds to *your* individual bum?",5
"I scored this just as my old Brooks Imperial began to tear. A warehouse deal in a ""damaged package"" meant that it had been opened, and the tension wrench was gone. Oh well. Best saddle for a bike at about the wholesale price? Cha-ching! Not my first Brooks, so I have the wrench already. Looking forward to this one out living the old bike, and being perfectly broken in on the next one. If you have never owned one of these... The beak in process is a big commitment; but super worth it. Easier than wearing wet jeans until they fit IMHO. That's ridiculous. Buy the official Proofhide conditioner, or a good product intended for baseball gloves. Nokona is what I use. Rub it in. Ride it. Add a little more occasionally. Sweating is okay if you keep it conditioned. But don't get leather wet. Rain covers exist. Get one if you commute. That's what ultimately killed my ~7 year old saddle. Don't get them wet. Don't feed them after midnight!",5
"As a young woman, I was an avide bike rider. This was before mountain bikes, century rides, charity ride, and I did this all on a 10 speed road bike..  Fast forward 30 years.  Life prevented me from ridding like I used to.  I was gifted with a bike a few weeks ago after telling numerous people of my plans to support my daughter on her 100 mile run by riiding along the route.  I have never been in such pain in my life with that factory seat.  Not 1 mile passed without my wanting to get off and give up.  Butts are not supposed to hurt like that, so I knew it was the seat.  An acquaintance asked what saddle I used before, and I remembered it was a Brooks leather saddle.  Well he convinced me that is what I needed. While reviews I have read indicated there is 1000 mile break-in period, for me it has been instant relief. My first ride was 4 miles of pure comfort, and each subsequent one has gotten longer and are equally comfortable.  I would recommend this saddle to anyone who plans on logging lots of miles.  Don't let the fact that it is hard  as rock out of the box fool you, it really is a superb seat!",5
"I first bought a Team Pro Imperial  (Honey Brown)  a couple of months ago to replace another saddle I had been using on my Cannondale R1000 road bike.  It felt great from the first time I rode using it.  I treated it per the instructions before installing it on my bike.  With some bar tape to match it has a great vintage look and is very comfortable.  My second ride with it was a mountainous metric century and I finished it with absolutely no discomfort from the saddle! I have been rebuilding an old touring bike and needed a saddle for it.  Since the Team Pro worked so well I decided to order another Brooks saddle.  My only fault (sort of) with the Team Pro is that there are no eyelets nor other good way to tie a tool bag to the seat.  So,  I ordered a B17 Imperial in standard width and brown color.  Dimensions are very similar to the Team Pro but the frame has eyelets for my toolbag.  One of the first things that I noticed is that the leather on the B17 is noticeably thinner than the leather on the Team Pro.  That makes the seat a bit more flexible and I guess it will be ""broken in"" a bit quicker than the other saddle.  As with the first saddle,  it was comfortable from the first time I sat on it.  That makes the break in time a non-issue for me. I am very pleased with both of my Brooks saddles.  They are a bit more comfortable for me than the ""men's anatomic saddles"" that I had been using previously.  There have been no perineal issues for me which can make a huge difference in whether a saddle works for  long hours on the bike or not.  I would not hesitate to buy another one in the future.",5
"I have ridden somewhere north of a half a dozen higher end saddles. Last year the saddle I had purchased really damaged one side of my butt so I decided to finally give this saddle a chance even though I thought I needed one of the fancy aerodynamic racing/endurance saddles. Well, I have to say that this saddle is so much better than any other saddle that I have ridden that I am completely in shock. Not only did the right side of my bum feel much better while on the Brooks saddle but it has actually healed up since I've gotten it. If you want a saddle that is going to treat you right then this is the one, bums down!",5
"I was a bit hesitant at first to buy this saddle. Upon my unboxing, it seemed a but hard. And I even had half the mond to return it. But this has by far been the best addition to my roadbike. I ride it to and from school nearly daily after having bought this but plan on making my roadbike as my main means of transport. What a differemce this B17 Standard saddle has made on my ride. Wow wow wow!!! They say ""only mileage can break this saddle in"" and this is true. But let me tell you I am a 5'2"" female weighing in about 125 measley pounds and it only took 4 rides (roughly 50 miles) before it started feeling cushy!!!! Granted I ride my bike with a backpack stuffed with my laptop and chemistry text book. But it feels amazing after having broken it in! I now prefer my bike to be my choice of transport. I use my car only when I had decided to sleep in a little bit longer. But I cannot stress what a difference this little saddle has made! You won't regret it.",5

"Received this product very recently. It's hard to believe that a seat designed a hundred years ago might still be a decent design. But based on the reviews here, I bought one.  I put it on my bike and took the first ride. My first impression was favorable, even though the seat did not give much in just one ride, as other reviewers have posted; it takes a number of long rides to break in the saddle. But my impression is that the seat on first ride is at least as comfortable as the seat that came with my bike, which was a seat made by Giant on a $1,100 Giant bicycle. I have favorable expectations of the Brooks seat, but I will post an update after a couple hundred miles. Update: I wrote the above review after one ten-mile ride. I usually do at least twenty miles per ride, and the Brooks seat is hard on the coño after ten miles, so much so that I'm unable to ride for several days, so it's taking a lot longer to break in.  It seems to me the seat should be more hammock-shaped, like the seat that came with my Giant road bike.  Instead, my Brooks seat is very slightly humped right in the middle, not much, mind you, but even just a little is causing pain.  I'm inclined to loosen the adjustment bolt. I'm reducing this review from four to three stars. With as many people who complain about the break in period, you'd think Brooks would have figured out a solution. Second update: I am trying to break this saddle in, but I see no change in the saddle. It's still hard and non pliable. I used the entire small tin container of paraffin wax that Brooks sent with the saddle. Nothing's changed.  I only have about a hundred miles on the seat, though. I'll keep working it until 400 miles, which is the longest time I've seen anyone claim the seat takes to break in. If anyone has a suggestion for treating the saddle other than the very expensive Proofide that Brooks supplies, please let me know. Brooks is gouging customers at 15 bucks for an ounce of the product.",3
I want to start by saving I loved the Brooks B17 Standard Saddle and should they honor the warranty which I have just filed a warranty claim for I will def change my review to 5 stars. The 1 Star rating is only based on the mileage I received out of the bike saddle prior to the rail breaking. I purchased the saddle on 12/14/2018 and on 11/10/2019 a Rail on the saddle broke rendering the seat unusable. Prior to the saddle rail breaking I loved the saddle and found it both comfortable and beautiful. As mentioned I have filed a warranty claim with Brooks since Amazon does not offer a return feature likely due to how long ago it was ordered. Should brooks honor the warranty and fix the seat rail I will certainly update my review. One issue I am concerned with is if there is no way to replace the rail without replacing the leather I will lose all of the care and maintenance I have given to the seat getting it to the comfortable worn in state it is currently in. My ratings would be the following under the following conditions: * Brooks warranty replaces just rail keeping my current leather. 5 stars * Brooks warranty replaces seat with another B17 Standard that has new leather. 3 stars * Brooks warranty replaces seat with pre-aged B17 leather. 5 stars I took special care of the seat applying the conditioner and tightening it as instructed which yeilded a very comfortable ride. My hope is to avoid having to redo all of that as a result of *hopefully* a bad rail. My other fear is that the rails aren't of high quality like the leather is and this may happen again.,1
"I have it 3 stars because I'm not sure what to think about this saddle. I read many many reviews and I understand that it can take hundreds of hours before it even begins to feel comfortable. I honestly just don't feel like I want to wait. The seat can feel so uncomfortable at first, that it's hard to imagine it getting any better. Like I said, even it they say it feels like sitting on a cloud later on, I just don't see it happening for me. Sorry Brooks. Maybe I'll put it back on my bike at some point and try again.",3
"Purchased this saddle after purchasing original B17.  B17 is still in good condition.  After approx 4,000 miles (4-5 months of riding) this B17 Imperial Saddle has completely collapsed on both sides of the split.  It was never wet and laces were used.  Completely disappointed in this saddle but still impressed with the original B17.  Maybe this saddle is simply made for small riders (I am 6'1"" 185lb). Will stick with original B17s from now on.",2
"You have to wonder if Brooks could have put any less of the stuff in the envelope. It is not enough accomplish the job, and they know it.

Great material obviously and very good look however for the price if you’re looking for a good comfortable seat then I recommend something else for the money. But if you’re looking for a speak look with high quality then this is the right seat for you. It will be hard and somewhat uncomfortable until broken in since it is a very hard molded leather. Make sure to use the leather wax provided and maybe buy more for the future to help it mold to your butt crack.,3
"Aesthetically it's great. It is truly a beautiful saddle. They say there is a break in period. I found it so slippery and uncomfortable that I couldn't manage to put in more than a couple rides before giving up on it completely. I spent more time thinking about my rear and struggling to keep it on the saddle than enjoying the ride. I have a C17 Cambium cut-out I've been riding for about four months and it is by far the most comfortable saddle I've ever ridden. I bought the B17 narrow after all the praise I've heard, but it didn't really work for me.",3
The leather feels like its leathered with butter and made me slip off the seat with every pedal. It would be bad if it had some sort of traction on it and cost half the price,1
After 2000Km it still felt hard as a rock. Not comfortable at all. Also very sensitive to water. The cover sold by brooks wouldn.t protect it at all from the rain. Sold mine and don't regret it.,3
"I think people talk themselves into thinking they like this saddle because ""everyone else does"" and they paid so much for it. Yes it is nicely made, but it is NOT comfortable.

I put it on my bike and took the first ride. My first impression was favorable, even though the seat did not give much in just one ride, as other reviewers have posted; it takes a number of long rides to break in the saddle. But my impression is that the seat on first ride is at least as comfortable as the seat that came with my bike, which was a seat made by Giant on a $1,100 Giant bicycle. I have favorable expectations of the Brooks seat, but I will post an update after a couple hundred miles. Update: I wrote the above review after one ten-mile ride. I usually do at least twenty miles per ride, and the Brooks seat is hard on the coño after ten miles, so much so that I'm unable to ride for several days, so it's taking a lot longer to break in.  It seems to me the seat should be more hammock-shaped, like the seat that came with my Giant road bike.  Instead, my Brooks seat is very slightly humped right in the middle, not much, mind you, but even just a little is causing pain.  I'm inclined to loosen the adjustment bolt. I'm reducing this review from four to three stars. With as many people who complain about the break in period, you'd think Brooks would have figured out a solution. Second update: I am trying to break this saddle in, but I see no change in the saddle. It's still hard and non pliable. I used the entire small tin container of paraffin wax that Brooks sent with the saddle. Nothing's changed.  I only have about a hundred miles on the seat, though. I'll keep working it until 400 miles, which is the longest time I've seen anyone claim the seat takes to break in. If anyone has a suggestion for treating the saddle other than the very expensive Proofide that Brooks supplies, please let me know. Brooks is gouging customers at 15 bucks for an ounce of the product.",3
I want to start by saving I loved the Brooks B17 Standard Saddle and should they honor the warranty which I have just filed a warranty claim for I will def change my review to 5 stars. The 1 Star rating is only based on the mileage I received out of the bike saddle prior to the rail breaking. I purchased the saddle on 12/14/2018 and on 11/10/2019 a Rail on the saddle broke rendering the seat unusable. Prior to the saddle rail breaking I loved the saddle and found it both comfortable and beautiful. As mentioned I have filed a warranty claim with Brooks since Amazon does not offer a return feature likely due to how long ago it was ordered. Should brooks honor the warranty and fix the seat rail I will certainly update my review. One issue I am concerned with is if there is no way to replace the rail without replacing the leather I will lose all of the care and maintenance I have given to the seat getting it to the comfortable worn in state it is currently in. My ratings would be the following under the following conditions: * Brooks warranty replaces just rail keeping my current leather. 5 stars * Brooks warranty replaces seat with another B17 Standard that has new leather. 3 stars * Brooks warranty replaces seat with pre-aged B17 leather. 5 stars I took special care of the seat applying the conditioner and tightening it as instructed which yeilded a very comfortable ride. My hope is to avoid having to redo all of that as a result of *hopefully* a bad rail. My other fear is that the rails aren't of high quality like the leather is and this may happen again.,1
"I have it 3 stars because I'm not sure what to think about this saddle. I read many many reviews and I understand that it can take hundreds of hours before it even begins to feel comfortable. I honestly just don't feel like I want to wait. The seat can feel so uncomfortable at first, that it's hard to imagine it getting any better. Like I said, even it they say it feels like sitting on a cloud later on, I just don't see it happening for me. Sorry Brooks. Maybe I'll put it back on my bike at some point and try again.",3
"Purchased this saddle after purchasing original B17.  B17 is still in good condition.  After approx 4,000 miles (4-5 months of riding) this B17 Imperial Saddle has completely collapsed on both sides of the split.  It was never wet and laces were used.  Completely disappointed in this saddle but still impressed with the original B17.  Maybe this saddle is simply made for small riders (I am 6'1"" 185lb). Will stick with original B17s from now on.",2
"You have to wonder if Brooks could have put any less of the stuff in the envelope. It is not enough accomplish the job, and they know it.  Rather than give in and buy more  Proofide -- which we are solemnly told is the only substance that should be used on Brooks saddles-- from Brooks, I am just going to return the saddle on principle.",3
Great material obviously and very good look however for the price if you’re looking for a good comfortable seat then I recommend something else for the money. But if you’re looking for a speak look with high quality then this is the right seat for you. It will be hard and somewhat uncomfortable until broken in since it is a very hard molded leather. Make sure to use the leather wax provided and maybe buy more for the future to help it mold to your butt crack.,3
"Aesthetically it's great. It is truly a beautiful saddle. They say there is a break in period. I found it so slippery and uncomfortable that I couldn't manage to put in more than a couple rides before giving up on it completely. I spent more time thinking about my rear and struggling to keep it on the saddle than enjoying the ride. I have a C17 Cambium cut-out I've been riding for about four months and it is by far the most comfortable saddle I've ever ridden. I bought the B17 narrow after all the praise I've heard, but it didn't really work for me.",3
The leather feels like its leathered with butter and made me slip off the seat with every pedal. It would be bad if it had some sort of traction on it and cost half the price,1
After 2000Km it still felt hard as a rock. Not comfortable at all. Also very sensitive to water. The cover sold by brooks wouldn.t protect it at all from the rain. Sold mine and don't regret it.,3
